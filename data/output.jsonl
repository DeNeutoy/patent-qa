The nanofibers constituting the nanofiber layer  may be made of various materials. For example, the nanofibers may be made of polyester or polyimide. A thickness of the nanofiber may be 1 um to 20 um. In addition, it is possible to configure the nanofiber layer  with nanofibers of various thicknesses, as needed. The nanofibers may be metal plated so that the nanofiber layer  has electrical conductivity. A thickness of the nanofiber layer  may be 10 um to 20 um.

When the density of the nanofibers is less than 0.8 g/cm, the nanofiber layer  may not have sufficient electrical conductivity for noise shielding. When the density of the nanofibers exceeds 0.9 g/cm, a metal may not be sufficiently plated up to the nanofibers positioned inside the nanofiber layer . In this case, a current may not sufficiently flow in a direction (Y direction based on ) perpendicular to the longitudinal direction (X direction based on ) of the nanofiber layer . When a current does not appropriately flow in a vertical direction of the nanofiber layer , the nanofiber layer  may be substantially separated into two or more conductive layers. When the nanofiber layer  is separated into two or more conductive layers, resistance may increase and a noise shielding performance may decrease. In some cases, according to the length of the conductive layer separated into two or more, there is a risk of occurrence of a side effect in which noise is amplified because of resonance between noises of each conductive layer. Therefore, it may be preferable that the density of the nanofibers is 0.8 g/cmto 0.9 g/cm. The nanofiber layer  made of nanofibers plated within this density range may have electrical conductivity required to shield noise, and because a current flows smoothly in the vertical direction, a phenomenon may be prevented that the nanofiber layer  is separated into two conductive layers. For example, the density of the nanofibers may be 0.86 g/cm.", "According to various embodiments of the disclosure, metal plating processing on nanofibers may include coating an electrically conductive polymer material on the nanofibers.", "The nanofiber layer  made of flexible nanofibers has a high elastic modulus.

The metal particles  may be particles made of a highly conductive metal such as nickel, aluminum, or copper. The graphite particles  may be particles having a size larger than that of the metal particles . A volume occupied by the graphite particles  in the nanofiber layer  may be larger than that occupied by the metal particles  in the nanofiber layer .

In one embodiment, the separation distance L of the conductive member  may be determined to be less than 1/32 or less than 1/16 of a wavelength according to the driving frequency of the electronic component mounted in the first area . When the separation distance L is determined as described above, electromagnetic waves generated from the electronic component mounted in the first area may not pass through the conductive member . For example, when a speed of light is 3\u00d710m/s, if a driving frequency of the electronic component mounted in the first area  is 10 MHz, a wavelength may be 30 m.

When the second shielding layer  having magnetic permeability capable of effectively absorbing electromagnetic waves generated from each electronic component is used, electromagnetic waves generated from the corresponding electronic component may be more effectively absorbed.

So common are circuit board assemblies, that one would be hard pressed to find a household that had no products containing a circuit board assembly. During the development and manufacture of such circuit board assemblies, various circumstances can result in rework of one of more circuit board assemblies. For example, during product development, rework can be performed to address a problem identified during such a development phase. Such testing can be performed so as to reduce the number of revisions to the production of the circuit boards. During the production phase of a product, rework can be performed on returned detective products. Such rework can be performed so as to replace the faulty product or simply to determine the cause of the fault.", "Rework of circuit board assemblies requires careful localization of heating so as not to damage regions of such circuit board assemblies where rework is not desired. Localizing such heat can be difficult in practice, as heat is communicated via radiation, convection, and conduction, all three of which cause local heating to spread to adjacent regions. To reduce the undesirable spread of local heating, rapid heating and cooling techniques can be used. Thus, it would be desirable to find a method of providing local and rapid heating of a part adhesively attached to a circuit board assembly.", "Apparatus and associated methods relate to a system for removing an adhesively-attached component from a circuit board assembly.

In , component removal tool  is in the process of removing adhesively-attached component  from circuit board assembly . Component removal tool  is configured to heat to adhesives that attach adhesively-attached component  from circuit board assembly , so as to reduce the adhesion of adhesively-attached component  to circuit board assembly . When such adhesives are heated, the adhesion of adhesively-attached component  to circuit board assembly  can be significant reduced so that removal of adhesively-attached component  from circuit board assembly  is possible. Various types of adhesives can be used to attach adhesively-attached component  to circuit board assembly . Various solders, metals, and other adhesives are commonly used to attach electronic components to such circuit board assemblies, such as circuit board assembly . Such various adhesives can be used for conductive connection between leads of adhesively-attached component  and conduction traces of circuit board assembly . Some adhesives can be used for physical attachment only of adhesively-attached component  and circuit board assembly .", "Component removal tool  heats the adhesives used to attach adhesively-attached component  to circuit board assembly  either directly or indirectly using inductive heating techniques, as will be explained in more detail below. Component removal tool  includes coil driver , inductive coil , and complementary high-permeability members T and B. Complementary pair of high-permeability members T and B can be positioned on opposite sides of circuit board assembly  about adhesively-attached component . At least one of complementary pair the of high-permeability members T and B includes central pedestal T. In the depicted embodiment, top high-permeability member T includes central pedestal T. \u201cTop\u201d here refers to the one of complementary high-permeability members T and B that is situated on the same side of circuit board assembly  as the side that adhesively-attached component  is situated. The term \u201cbottom\u201d is used to refer to the other one of complementary high-permeability members T and B that is situated on the opposite side of circuit board assembly  as the side that adhesively-attached component  is situated. The terms \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d need not be indicative of a particular orientation of circuit board assembly .

Coil driver  is configured to generate an AC current in inductive coil  circumscribing central pedestal T, thereby inducing the magnetic field therein. Because high-permeability members T and B are made of high-permeability materials, any magnetic fields induced therein are channeled via the high-permeability members so as to minimize losses to the magnetic field induced. The magnetic field takes the path of \u201cleast resistance,\u201d which is a metaphor for the closed path of highest permeability. By directing the magnetic field, via complementary high-permeability members T and B, complementary high-permeability members T and B shield from magnetic field exposure circuitry outside an interior cavity defined by interior surfaces of high-permeability members T and B. Only the circuitry within such a cavity will be exposed to the magnetic field.", "At least one of complementary pair the of high-permeability members T and B has a peripheral pedestal. In the depicted embodiment both top and bottom high-permeability members T and B have central pedestals\u2014central pedestals T and B, respectively. Central pedestal T is configured to direct a magnetic field induced therein through the adhesively-attached component. Peripheral pedestals T and B are configured to provide a return path for the magnetic field about a periphery of the adhesively-attached component.", "In operation, complementary high-permeability members T and B are positioned on opposite sides of the circuit board assembly about the adhesively-attached component . High-permeability members T and B are positioned in clam-shell fashion so as to substantially enclose adhesively-attached component  within the interior cavity defined by interior surfaces of high-permeability members T and B. A magnetic field is then induced within high-permeability members T and B via AC excitation of inductive coil  by coil driver . The magnetic field induced is directed through adhesively-attached component  so as to induce AC currents with any conductive material within or below adhesively-attached component , thereby heating such conductive materials. Any solders, leads, circuit board traces, etc., which are located in this region where the magnetic field is directed will then heat due to these induced AC currents. Such heating can either directly heat the adhesives (e.g., if solder adhesives are located in this region) or indirectly heat the adhesives (e.g., via thermal conduction from the heated conductive materials to the adhesives).", "One the adhesives have been heated, adhesively-attached component  can be removed from circuit board assembly . Various methods of removing adhesively-attached component  from circuit board assembly  can be employed. For example, top high-permeability member T can be raised, and adhesively-attached component  can be manually removed using a tool, tweezers, etc. In some embodiments, top high-permeability member T can be equipped with a suction system to as to vacuum attach top high-permeability member T to a top surface of adhesively-attached component .

Bottom high-permeability member B includes peripheral pedestal B. Inductive coil  is wound about central pedestal T. Top high-permeability member T together with circuit board assembly  forms cavity , within which adhesively-attached component  is substantially enclosed or encapsulated. Bottom high-permeability member B is aligned with top high-permeability member T so as to facilitate maximize the permeability throughout a closed path about and through adhesively-attached component . Such maximization of the permeability throughout the closed circuit path facilitates high magnetic-field strength, thereby producing high indictive heating of conductive elements that intercept the closed path.", "is a side-elevation view of the component removal tool depicted in  with the magnetic flux indicated therein. In , the system depicted in  is annotated with magnetic field lines . Magnetic field lines  traverse a close path about and through adhesively-attached component . Magnetic field lines  correspond to a magnetic field induced by an AC current in inductive windings . Such an AC current in inductive windings  will induce a current in central pedestal T about which inductive windings are wound. This magnetic field will be directed about inductive windings  in a manner that traverses a path of least magnetic reluctance. Magnetic reluctance is inversely related to magnetic permeability. Thus, the magnetic field lines  will be preferentially directed in a path within high-permeability members T and B, as shown in the figure. Thus, magnetic field lines  traverse a path: i) from central pedestal T up to lateral field region T of top high-permeability member T; ii) then laterally outward from central pedestal T within lateral field region T to peripheral pedestal T; iii) then downward through peripheral pedestal T through circuit board assembly  to peripheral pedestal B; iv) then from peripheral pedestal B to lateral field region B; v) then laterally inward from peripheral pedestal B to a central region of bottom high-permeability member B; vi) then upward through circuit board assembly , solder balls , and adhesively-attached component , and back to central pedestal T again. Because magnetic field lines traverse circuit board assembly , solder balls , and adhesively-attached component , conductive elements, such as solder balls  within such a magnetic field will be inductively heated.", "Thus, these lateral field regions T and B provide connect any central pedestals T and B (if present) with any peripheral pedestals T and B (if present), respectively. Furthermore, any central pedestals T and B as well as any peripheral pedestals T and B extends from such lateral field regions T and B, respectively.", "This path in which the magnetic field is direction includes an annular region of circuit board assembly  that circumscribes adhesively-attached component  and a central region of adhesively-attached component  and a corresponding adjacent region of circuit board assembly .

Peripheral pedestal T is located between adhesively-attached component  and other devices affixed to the circuit board assembly adjacent to the adhesively-attached components, such as, for example additional component . Additional component  is shielded from exposure to the magnetic field by complementary high-permeability members T and B.", "is a plan view of the  embodiment of a component removal tool configured to inductively heat an adhesively-attached component.

In the depicted embodiment, central pedestal T has a square configuration. In some embodiments, central pedestal can be circular, rectangular or any other geometry appropriate for the specific adhesively-attached component to be extracted. About central pedestal T are show inductive windings . In the depicted embodiment, peripheral pedestal T is an annular pedestal that circumscribes central pedestal T without interruption. In some embodiments, in which the specific circuit board assembly requires interruption (e.g., due to a component located within the peripheral pedestal region), peripheral pedestal T can have one or more interruptions in its otherwise annular geometry.", "Bottom high-permeability member B includes peripheral pedestal B and lateral field region B only. In other embodiments, bottom high-permeability member B can have a central pedestal as well as other features. For example, bottom high-permeability member can include an inductive coil, such as inductive coil  either in addition to or instead of inductive coil  wound about central pedestal T of top high-permeability member T. In some embodiments, peripheral pedestals T and B are complementary such that, when aligned with one another, peripheral pedestals T and B are substantially coextensive in their lateral dimensions.", "is a side-elevation view of an embodiment of a component removal tool that facilitates both inductive and convective heating.

To facility the circulation of heated air, top high-permeability member T includes input apertures , and output apertures . Such apertures can be used to provide circulation of heated air within cavity , which can be produced by a forced air heating system. Input and second apertures are thus configured to provide a circulatory path for convective heating therethrough. For example, a force air heater can force air into input apertures  and then receive air exhausted from output apertures .", "is a side-elevation view of an embodiment of a component removal tool that includes a part extractor using vacuum technology.

A vacuum system can be fluidly connected to part suction port  so as to provide a suction that can cause central pedestal T to engage adhesively-attached component . Then, when solder balls  have melted (e.g., during reflow of the solder balls), top high-permeability member T can be removed, thereby removing component , whose melted solder balls  no longer provide adhesive attachment between component  and circuit board assembly .

Top high-permeability member T also differs in that peripheral pedestals T are configured to direct the magnetic field induced within top high-permeability member T through an annular periphery of adhesively-attached component . Thus, instead of directing the magnetic field through only circuit board assembly  in an annular region circumscribing adhesively-attached component , in the depicted embodiment, the magnetic field is directed through both the adhesively-attached component  and circuit board assembly . Thus, the magnetic field directed through such an annular region of adhesively-attached component  can provide additional inductive heating of conductive elements located in such an annular region.", "While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment(s), it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention.

Further, for the purpose of collating information, it is possible to have a configuration in which the line management device stores tape feeder information in which tape feeder IDs assigned to the tape feeders are linked with IDs of electronic components held by the tape feeders. In this configuration, the collating is done in the following manner. First, when a tape feeder is attached, the mounting work machine acquires the tape feeder ID assigned in advance to the tape feeder and transfers it to the line management device. Next, in the line management device, the tape feeder information is referred to and collated with the electronic component ID linked with the transferred tape feeder ID, and it is determined whether the tape feeder and the electronic component held by the tape feeder are usable.

That is, the transmitted additional information is stored in tape feeder database  as information of \u201c2\u201d or later in the \u201csupplying order\u201d. Further, communication device  transmits the information of the added component ID to tape feeder . When tape feeder  receives the added component ID information, tape feeder  stores the transmitted component ID information in memory section  as splicing information . The details of splicing information  stored in memory section  of tape feeder  will be described with reference to .", "For example, it is assumed that component tape  having the component ID of \u201cZ1111\u201d is mounted on tape feeder  having the feeder ID of \u201cCCC\u201d in which component tape  is not mounted on reel mounting section . In this instance, tape feeder information  in which feeder ID is \u201cCCC\u201d and component ID is \u201cZ1111\u201d is transmitted to tape feeder  in which feeder ID is \u201cCCC\u201d. Tape feeder  stores tape feeder information  in memory section . Further, as indicated by information  in , splicing information  is set to \u201c0\u201d. Next, it is assumed that component tape  having component ID \u201cZ2222\u201d is spliced and added to component tape  having component ID \u201cZ1111\u201d. In this instance, tape feeder  having feeder ID of \u201cCCC\u201d is transmitted with information indicating that component tape  having a component ID of \u201cZ2222\u201d has been added.

Further, when component tape  is added, tape feeder  similarly adds and updates the component ID of the added component tape  to splicing information . As described above, splicing information  is information in which the component IDs are spliced, that is, information in which tape feeders  are arranged in the supplying order to mounting machine .", "shows an example of tape feeder database  stored in line management device  in the case of the above-described example. The number of rows in which the value of the item \u201cfeeder ID\u201d of tape feeder database  is \u201cCCC\u201d is 3, which is the same as the number of component tapes  mounted on tape feeder  having the feeder ID \u201cCCC\u201d. The value of the \u201ccomponent ID\u201d in each of the three rows is \u201cZ1111\u201d \u201cZ2222\u201d \u201cZ3333\u201d, and the values of the items of the \u201csupplying order\u201d are \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, and \u201c3\u201d, respectively. In this manner, for the same feeder ID, the component ID whose value of the \u201csupplying order\u201d of tape feeder database  is \u201c1\u201d matches the component ID of tape feeder information  stored in tape feeder . In addition, for the same feeder ID, the component ID whose value of the \u201csupplying order\u201d in tape feeder database  is \u201c2\u201d or later matches the component ID of splicing information  stored in tape feeder .", "When component tape  of tape feeder  is depleted by the mounting work of mounting machine , control circuit  of tape feeder  transmits information indicating that component tape  has been depleted to mounting machine . When mounting machine  receives information indicating the depletion, mounting machine  transfers the information indicating the depletion to line management device .

On the other hand, when splicing information  is not stored in memory section , control circuit  of tape feeder  deletes component ID  of tape feeder information .", "In addition, even when component tape  is spliced and added by the user in a state where tape feeder  is mounted in slot  of mounting machine , tape feeder information  and splicing information  stored in memory section  are updated. Similar to the preparation work, when the user splices and adds component tape  to tape feeder , the user assigns a number to slot , which will be described later, and causes bar codes ,  to be read by a bar code reader (not shown). The bar code reader transmits the number of the specified slot  and the read feeder ID and component ID to mounting machine . When mounting machine  receives the number of the specified slot  and the read feeder ID and component ID, mounting machine  transmits the component ID to tape feeder  mounted in the number of the specified slot .

The multiple slots  included in tape feeder holding stand  are assigned numbers in advance in order to enable identification of positions. The collation data includes information indicating in which slot , among the multiple slots , tape feeder  holding component tape  should be placed.", "When CPU  determines that tape feeder  is mounted in slot  based on the detector output signals, the collation process is initiated. First, in step S, CPU  causes second interface  to read tape feeder information  and splicing information  stored in memory section  of tape feeder . When CPU  reads out tape feeder information  and splicing information  via second interface , CPU  transmits signals to line management device  requesting collation of tape feeder information  and splicing information  (S). When CPU  of line management device  receives the signal requesting collation, line management device  determines whether the received tape feeder information  and splicing information  match with stored tape feeder database .", "More specifically, CPU  extracts a row that matches the values of the received feeder ID in tape feeder database . Next, CPU  determines whether the component ID of \u201c1\u201d in the \u201csupply order\u201d among extracted rows matches the component ID of the received tape feeder information . When CPU  determines that the component ID whose \u201csupplying order\u201d is \u201c1\u201d matches the component ID of the received tape feeder information , CPU  then determines whether each of the component IDs whose \u201csupplying order\u201d is \u201c2\u201d and later matches each of the component IDs of the received splicing information . If it is determined that each of the component IDs having a \u201csupplying order\u201d of \u201c2\u201d or later matches each of the component IDs of the received splicing information , CPU  determines that the received splicing information matches tape feeder database . On the other hand, in the case that CPU  determines that the component ID having the \u201csupplying order\u201d of \u201c1\u201d does not match the component ID of the received tape feeder information  and determines that the component ID having the \u201csupplying order\u201d of \u201c2\u201d or later does not match the component ID of the received splicing information , CPU  determines that the component ID does not match tape feeder database . When the feeder ID of the received tape feeder information  is not recorded in tape feeder database , CPU  determines that the ID does not match with tape feeder database .", "Here, when it is determined that CPU  does not match, the following cases are assumed. One is a case where component tape  is mounted in empty tape feeder  on which component tape  is not mounted, for example, in production line , which is different from production line  in which the collation process is executed, and is a case in which tape feeder information  and splicing information  stored in memory section  are stored. Further, for example, tape feeder  used in production line  is moved to production line  by the user, and a new component tape  is spliced in production line . As described above, when an inconsistency is determined in step S, it is considered that component tape  actually mounted on tape feeder  does not match the information of tape feeder database  stored in line management device .", "CPU  of line management device  transmits a signal indicating \u201cmatch\u201d when it is determined that mounting machine  which requested collation is consistent, and CPU  transmits a signal indicating \u201cnon-match\u201d when it is determined that mounting machine  is inconsistent. After executing step S, CPU  determines whether tape feeder information  and splicing information  transmitted to line management device  match tape feeder database  stored in line management device  (S). When a signal indicating a consistency is transmitted from line management device , CPU  determines that a match occurs (S: YES), and when a signal indicating an inconsistency is transmitted from the line management device , CPU  determines that a match does not occur (S: NO).", "If it is determined that the electronic components are matched (S: YES), CPU  determines that the mounting of electronic components supplied from mounted tape feeder  is to be performed (S) and ends the collation process. On the other hand, if it is determined that the electronic components are not matched (S: NO), CPU  determines that mounting of electronic components supplied from mounted tape feeder  is not to be performed and stops the mounting of supplied electronic components (S). Next, a message prompting collation, such as \u201cPlease re-register the tape feeder\u201d is displayed on operation device  (S), for example, and the collation process is terminated. By displaying the resume-collation message, the user becomes aware that tape feeder database  stored in line management device  and component tape  actually mounted on tape feeder  are different from each other.

Line management device  extracts the value of the component ID that matches the feeder ID transmitted from tape feeder database , and determines whether the value of the extracted component ID and the number of slot  match with the collation data. As a result, it is determined whether component tape  of tape feeder  attached to mounting machine  of the transmitting source is mounted in slot  having the same number as the collation data, whether component tape  can be used in mounting machine , and the like. If it is determined that line management device  is consistent, line management device  sends a signal indicating usability to mounting machine . Upon receiving a signal indicating the availability from line management device , mounting machine  performs mounting work of an electronic component supplied from tape feeder . Line management device  transmits the value of the component ID extracted from tape feeder database  at the same time as transmitting the signal indicating availability. Mounting machine  stores the transmitted component ID values in RAM  in association with the corresponding feeder IDs.", "In step S of the matching process, when component tape  mounted on tape feeder  matches with tape feeder database , matching with the matching data is performed. As described above, since component tape  actually mounted on tape feeder  is compared with the matching data, erroneous mounting, for example, which may occur when comparing with tape feeder database  without having the latest tape feeder information, is suppressed. As described above, tape feeder database  is information used for creating traceability information. By using tape feeder database  used for creating traceability information, it is possible to perform a matching process for determining whether tape feeder database  matches component tape  actually mounted on tape feeder .", "Here, production system  is an example of a production system, the mounting machines ,  are examples of electronic component mounting machines, production lines ,  are examples of multiple production lines, line management devices ,  are examples of line management devices, component tape  is an example of a component tape, and tape feeder  is an example of a tape feeder.

In step S, the result of mismatching is received, and when it is determined that mismatching has occurred, mounting work of electronic components supplied from tape feeder  is stopped in step S.", "A case, in which tape feeder information  stored in tape feeder  and tape feeder database  do not match, may be a case where tape feeder , in which component tape  is mounted in another production line, is mounted on mounting machine . In such a case, since the collation with the collation data is likely to be performed in tape feeder database  without having the latest tape feeder information stored in line management device , erroneous mounting can be suppressed by stopping the mounting of the electronic component supplied from tape feeder .", "When component tape  is added by splicing to tape feeder  to which component tape  has already been mounted on reel mounting section , communication device  acquires from bar code reader  the feeder ID of tape feeder  and the component ID of the added component tape , and transmits additional information, in which the acquired feeder ID is linked to the acquired component ID, to line management device  of production line  to which component tape  is to be mounted. In addition, information of the added component ID, which is information indicating that component tape  has been added, is transmitted to tape feeder . When the additional information is transmitted from communication device , line management device  adds and stores the additional information in tape feeder database .

Therefore, tape feeder database  stored in line management device  matches the information stored in memory section  of tape feeder  in which splicing information  has been updated by communication device  of the same production line. In other words, when tape feeder  whose splicing information  has been updated in another production line is mounted on mounting machine , tape feeder database  of line management device  of the mounted production line does not match splicing information  stored in the mounted tape feeder . Therefore, the case where component tapes  are not aligned is, for example, a case where tape feeder  to which component tapes  are added in another production line is mounted on mounting machine . In such a case, since the collation with the collation data is likely to be performed in tape feeder database  without having the latest tape feeder information stored in line management device , erroneous mounting can be suppressed by stopping the mounting of the electronic component supplied from tape feeder .", "When the information of the added component ID is transmitted, tape feeder  stores the transmitted component ID as splicing information .

In this case, tape feeder  updates splicing information  to \u201c2\u201d as indicated by information  in .

As described above, since mounting machine  stores the value of the component ID transmitted together with the signal indicating usability transmitted from line management device  at the time of matching with the matching data, mounting machine  transmits the component ID in which the stored supply order is \u201c2\u201d. When the component ID is transmitted from mounting machine , control circuit  of tape feeder  updates tape feeder information  by using the transmitted component ID as component ID  of tape feeder information .

For example, in the above description, it has been described that centralized management apparatus  transmits various data of a predetermined period to line management device . In addition, for example, when line management device  updates tape feeder database , production system  may transmit the update information to centralized management apparatus  each time, and centralized management apparatus  may transmit the update information to another line management device. Alternatively, for example, line management device  may periodically transmit the update information. In the case of such a configuration, for example, when a communication failure has not occurred in wide area network WAN, the latest tape feeder database shared by multiple line management devices is stored. For example, even in a state where a communication failure occurs in wide area network WAN and the line management device is not updated to the latest tape feeder database, erroneous mounting can be suppressed by executing the matching process. Alternatively, when it is determined in step S of the matching process that there is no match, the line management device may request centralized management apparatus  to transmit the update information.

having a rotary head has been proposed as a mounting device in which multiple pick-up nozzles are circumferentially attached to a rotary body, and while the rotary body rotates, the rotary head picks up components at a first position and a second position (see, for example, Patent Literature 1). Since components can be picked up at multiple positions, throughput is improved with this device.", "Patent Literature 1: U.S. Pat. No. 6,177,342", "However, in the mounting device of Patent Literature 1, picking up a large-sized component, such as interfering with an adjacent pick-up nozzle or a component picked up by an adjacent nozzle, was not considered.

In this mounting device, since the second component is held at a lowered position, it is possible to prevent interference with an adjacent pickup member, a first component picked up by an adjacent pickup member, or the like. Therefore, for example, the first component and the second component larger than the first component can be held and moved in the same step. Further, picking up the second component first may interfere with picking up the first component, but here, since the second component is picked up after the first component, the first component and the second component can be picked up without interference. Similarly, picking up a nearby first component while second component is held may cause interference with the second component, but here, since the second component is released preferentially, the first component and the second component can be released without interference.

Mounting device  performs, with mounting head , a process of picking up general-purpose component P (first component) and large-sized component Pa (second component) in the same step and positioning them on board S. Here, general-purpose component P and large-sized component Pa are collectively referred to as components P, Reference height H and lowered position H may be, for example, determined empirically to have heights that do not interfere with other members while components P are held. General-purpose component P has, for example, a size and a shape that does not interfere with adjacent pick-up nozzles  or components P while general-purpose component P is being picked up by pick-up nozzle . In mounting head , all of components P being held rotate synchronously about the central axis of the pick-up nozzles . Therefore, in mounting head , as shown by the dotted circle in , care is taken so that each component does not interfere with rotation regions obtained by adding a predetermined margin to the component size of each component. Large-sized component Pa is, for example, a component having a size that interferes with the tip of adjacent pick-up nozzle  and/or component P held at the tip of adjacent pick-up nozzle  when large-sized component Pa is picked up by pick-up nozzle  and held at reference height Hi. As shown in , large-sized component Pa is set as a lowered-position held component held at lowered position H lower than reference height H, and information of \u201cnecessary\u201d is given to lowered-position held of component information  (see ). In the mounting device, large-sized component Pa was not held in the same step as general-purpose component P, but in mounting device , as many components P as possible are held in the same step.", "Next, the operation of mounting system  of the present embodiment configured as described above, in particular, the process of picking up components P and setting the placement order of components P in management PC  will be described. Here, details of the operation is described in view of a case where eight pick-up nozzles  can be attached to mounting head , and lowered position at which component P can be picked up is \u201cPosition \u201d.  is a flowchart showing an example of a mounting-condition setting process routine executed by CPU  of management PC . This routine is stored in storage section  and executed based on an operator's mounting-condition creation start input. When this routine is started, CPU  first acquires information on components P mounted on board S by mounting device  and provisionally sets the placement order of components P based on a predetermined priority order (S). For example, CPU  may specify components P from information of board S to be produced, such as CAD data, and acquire information for each component P. Further, the predetermined priority order may be determined by prioritizing one or more of the followings based on experience, such as multiple components P that can be simultaneously picked up, components P which result in a shorter moving distance of mounting head , components P yielding a smaller number of exchanges of pick-up nozzles , and the like.", "Next, CPU  selects component P in order from the top of the provisionally set placement order (S), and determines whether the selected component P is a lowered-position held component (S). CPU  determines whether the component is a lowered-position held component based on the lowered-position held information included in component information . If selected component P is not a lowered-position held component, CPU  determines whether pick-up nozzle  at another position is available to pick up the component in the same step (S), and if a pick-up nozzle is available to pick up the component, executes S and subsequent processes. That is, the components are selected until there is no pick-up nozzle  available to perform a pick up, and the maximum number of components P that can be picked up in the same step is set. When the step includes large-sized component Pa, components P cannot be held by the two adjacent pick-up nozzles  (see ), in which case, CPU  determines that the maximum number of pick-up nozzles  that can be picked up is . On the other hand, when component P is a lowered-position held component in S, CPU  determines whether a lowered position is available (S). In mounting head , the lowered position is \u201cPosition \u201d, and two pick-up nozzles , can be lowered at the same time. This determination is made so as not to set lowered-position held components exceeding the number of lowered positions in the same step. When a lowered position is available, CPU  performs S and subsequent processes. On the other hand, when a lowered position is not available, CPU  removes the selected component from the same step, performs a process of incorporating the selected component into a later step (S), and performs the process of S and subsequent processes,", "When other positions are not available in S, CPU  determines that the number of components that can be held in the same step is maximized, and performs a process of changing the pickup and pickup-release order in the same step as required (S to S).  is a figure showing an example of changing the order of picking up and releasing large-sized component Pa,  is a table showing a provisionally set initial order of picking up and releasing large-sized component Pa, and  is a table showing the order of picking up and releasing after the change in the order. In this process, CPU  determines whether there is a lowered-position held component among the selected components P (S), and when there is no lowered-position held component, CPU  sets the current component order as same as the order of picking up and releasing in the same step. For example, since the pickup order  to  in  does not include the lowered-position held component, in this step, the pickup order and the pickup-release order are determined without change (). On the other hand, when there is a lowered-position held component among the selected components P, the order is changed to an order which makes such a lowered-position held component to be held later with the lowered position, and thereby the pickup order is set (S). For example, since the pickup order  to  in  includes large-sized component Pa, large-sized component Pa is changed to a later pickup order (). In mounting head , only first lifting/lowering position A and second lifting/lowering position B can be lowered to the lowered position, and when large-sized component Pa is picked up prior to other components P, rotary portion  cannot be rotated. Here, since large component Pa is picked up later, it is possible to pick up another component P. When the number of lowered-position held components is smaller than the number of lowered positions, in accordance with the available lowered positions, CPU  may assume an order in which the lowered-position held components are picked up by the lowered positions at the final order position, or assume an order in which the lowered-position held components are picked up at the second from the final order position.", "After S, CPU  changes to an order in which the lowering-position held component is released earlier and sets the pickup-release order (S). For example, since the pickup order  to  in  includes large-sized component Pa, the pickup-release order of large-sized component Pa is changed to an earlier order position (). In mounting head , when pick-up nozzle  is lowered to the lowered position, rotary portion  cannot be rotated. Here, since the lowered-position held component is released earlier, it becomes possible to release another component P. When the number of lowered-position held components held is smaller than the number of lowered positions, CPU , in accordance with the availabilities, may make a pickup-release order in which the lowered-position held components are released first or make a pickup-release order in which the lowered-position held components are released second from the beginning.", "After S or after S, CPU  determines whether there is a next component P to be picked up (S), and when there is a next component P to be picked up, that is, when there is a next step, CPU  repeats S and subsequent processes. On the other hand, when there is no next component P to be picked up in S, it is assumed that the pickup order and the pickup-release order have been set for all components P, and CPU  determines whether the setting of the pickup and pickup-release orders have been performed a predetermined number of times set beforehand (S). When the setting of the pickup and pickup-release orders have not reached the predetermined number of times, CPU  changes the setting conditions of the pickup and pickup-release order (S), and repeats S and subsequent processes. As a change of the setting condition, for example, CPU  may exchange the placement order of any component P. When S sets the placement order a predetermined number of times, CPU  selects the shortest one of the set pickup and pickup-release orders (S), stores the selected pickup and pickup-release orders as mounting-condition information in storage section  (S), and ends the routine as is. In this manner, mounting-condition information  that causes mounting head  to hold large-sized component Pa together with as many other components P as possible is created. Mounting device  acquires mounting condition information  before executing the mounting process, stores mounting condition information  in storage section  as mounting condition information , and uses mounting condition information  for the mounting process.", "Next, the mounting process executed by mounting device  using the created mounting-condition information will be described.  is a flowchart showing an example of a mounting process executed by CPU  of mounting device . This routine is stored in storage section  and executed based on an operator's mounting start input. When this routine is started, CPU  first reads out and acquires mounting-condition information  (S), and causes board processing section  to perform the conveyance and securing process on board S (S). Next, CPU  sets component P to be picked up based on the pickup order of mounting-condition information  (S). Here, it is assumed that CPU  sets one or more components P to be picked up in the same step. Next, CPU  attaches or exchanges pick-up nozzles  as required, and performs a pickup process of component P (S). At this time, if the lowered-position held component is included in the same step, CPU  picks up the lowered-position held component later. Then, CPU  moves component P so that mounting head  passes over component imaging section  and causes component imaging section  to image held component P (S).", "Next, by using the captured image, CPU  determines whether there are errors in component P held by mounting head  (S). Examples of errors in component P include shape abnormalities, a pickup position deviation outside an allowable range, and the like. When there are no errors in held component P, CPU  corrects the pickup position deviation to release component P and position component P on board S (S). At this time, when the lowered-position held component is included in the same step, CPU  releases the lowered-position held component earlier. On the other hand, when there is an error in held component P in S, CPU  discards the erroneous component at a predetermined discarding position, corrects the pickup position deviation with respect to the remaining component P and releases component P to place component P on board S (S). At this time, when the lowered-position held component is included in the same step, CPU  releases the lowered-position held component earlier. CPU  changes the target coordinates of the placement position in mounting-condition information , and when the lowered-position held component is an erroneous component, CPU  releases the erroneous component at the discarding position earlier, and when the lowered-position held component is not an erroneous component, CPU  releases the erroneous component at the placement position on board S earlier. Subsequently, CPU  sets the discarded component P as a component-to-be-repositioned (S).", "After S or after S, CPU  determines whether the mounting process of the current board has been completed (S), and if not, executes S and subsequent processes. That is, CPU  sets component P to be picked up next, exchanges pick-up nozzles  as required, images component P. corrects the deviation, and positions component P on board S. On the other hand, when the mounting process of the current board is completed in S, CPU  causes board processing section  to discharge board S on which mounting has been completed (S), and determines whether the mounting jobs of the predetermined mounting-condition information  have been completed (S). When the mounting jobs of mounting-condition information  are not completed, CPU  executes S and subsequent processes. When mounting jobs of mounting-condition information  are completed, CPU  determines whether there is a component-to-be-repositioned (S), and when there is no component-to-be-repositioned, the routine is ended as is.", "On the other hand, when there is a component-to-be-repositioned in , the pickup and pickup-release order setting process is executed for one or more components-to-be-repositioned (S). This process may be the execution of S to S of the mounting-condition setting process routine. That is, CPU  provisionally sets the placement order on the basis of the moving distances of mounting head  and the like, and sets the pickup order and the pickup-release order as they are when there are no lowered-position held components in the same step. On the other hand, when there is a lowered-position held component in the same step, CPU  picks up the lowered-position held component later, and sets the pickup order and the pickup-release order for releasing the lowered-position held component earlier. CPU  then performs the pickup process of the component-to-be-repositioned (S), corrects the pickup deviation and releases the component-to-be-repositioned to place the component-to-be-repositioned on board S (S), and ends the routine. In performing the processes of S, S, CPU  may perform the processes of the above S\u02dcS, As described above, mounting device  can hold large-sized member Pa together with general-purpose component P at the same time and perform the mounting process.", "Here, the correspondence between the constituent elements of the present embodiment and the constituent elements of the present disclosure will be specified. Mounting head  of the present embodiment corresponds to the mounting head of the present disclosure, mounting control section  corresponds to the mounting control section, and control device  corresponds to the setting control section.

In mounting device , since the second component is held at lowered position H, it is possible to prevent interference with adjacent pick-up nozzle , component P picked up by adjacent pick-up nozzle , or the like. Therefore, for example, the first component and the second component can be held and moved in the same step. Further, picking up the second component first may interfere with picking up the first component, but here, since the second component is picked up after the first component, the first component and the second component can be picked up without interference. Similarly, picking up a nearby first component while second component is held may cause interference with the second component, but here, since the second component is released preferentially, the first component and the second component can be released without interference.

Mounting control section  does not rotate rotary portion  after the second component is picked up, but rotates rotary portion  after the second component is released. Therefore, in mounting device , since rotary portion  is not rotated while holding the second component, component P is held more reliably. Further, mounting head  has two or more lowered positions to which pick-up nozzle  is lowered, and mounting control section  causes pick-up nozzle  of the lowered position to pick up the second component at the end of the same step in which mounting head  is caused to pick up multiple components P, and mounting control section  causes pick-up nozzles  at the lowered position to release components earlier starting from the second component held at lowered position H. In mounting device , since multiple lowered positions can be effectively utilized, the production efficiency can be further improved. Furthermore, mounting control section  causes pick-up nozzle  at the lower position to pick up the second component, and then causes pick-up nozzle  at the other lower position to pick up the second component when picking up the other second component. In mounting device , since multiple second components can be picked up, the production efficiency can be further improved.", "Further, for he component-to-be-repositioned or the like, mounting control section  sets the pickup order in which a second component is picked up by pick-up nozzle  after a first component, and sets the pickup-release order in which a second component is picked by pick-up nozzle  before a first component. In mounting device , the pickup order and the pickup-release order can be set, for example, even when a change in the mounting order becomes necessary later, the first component and the second component can be mixed and then picked up and released, thereby making it possible to further improve production efficiency.

In this mounting device, since the cylindrical portion is not rotated while holding the second component in the rotary head, the component can be held more reliably.", "In the mounting device of the present disclosure, the mounting head may have two or more lowered positions to which the pickup member is lowered; and the mounting control section causes the pickup member of the lowered position to pick up the second component at the end of the same step in which the mounting head is caused to pick up multiple components, and the mounting control section causes pickup members at the lowered position to release components earlier starting from the second component at the lowered position. Since multiple lowered positions can be effectively utilized with this mounting device, the production efficiency can be further improved. Here, \u201cin the same step\u201d means, for example, a step in which the mounting head picks up one or more components, and then positions (and discards) the components and move to the next pickup position.", "In the mounting device of the present disclosure, the mounting head may have two or more lowered positions for lowering the pickup member, and when, after picking up the second component with the pickup member at the lowered position, the mounting control section picks up another second component, the mounting control section may pick up said second component with the pickup member of another lowered position. Since multiple second components can be picked up with this mounting device, the production efficiency can be further improved.", "In the mounting device of the present disclosure, the mounting control section may set a pickup order in which the pickup member picks up the second component after the first component, and set a pickup-release order in which the second component is released from the pickup member before the first component. In this mounting device, the pickup order and the pickup-release order can be set, for example, even when a change in the mounting order becomes necessary later, the first component and the second component can be mixed and then picked up and released, thereby making it possible to improve the production efficiency.", "In the mounting device of the present disclosure, the second component may be a large-sized component that interferes with the tip of an adjacent pickup member and/or the first component held by the tip of the adjacent pickup member when picked up by a pickup member and held at a predetermined height. In this mounting device, the production efficiency can be further improved in the case where a large-sized component is involved.", "The information processing device of the present disclosure is an information processing device for use in a mounting system comprising a mounting device provided with a mounting head having multiple pickup members configured to pick up a component: the mounting device being configured to pick up and perform a mounting process on the components: the information processing device comprising: a setting control section configured to set a pickup order for picking up a second component later when a first component held by the mounting head at a predetermined height and a second component held by the mounting head at a lowered position lower than the predetermined height are picked up by the mounting head; and the setting control section is configured to set a pickup-release order for releasing the second component earlier when a component is released from the mounting head in which the first component and the second component are held.", "This information processing device can pick up, hold, and release the first component and the second component without interference, and can hold and move the first component and the second component in the same step, thereby making it possible to further improve the production efficiency, similarly to the mounting device described above. In this information processing device, various modes of the mounting device described above may be adopted, or a configuration for achieving each function of the mounting device described above may be added.", "The mounting method of the present disclosure is a mounting method for use in a mounting device provided with a mounting head having multiple pickup members configured to pick up components, the mounting device being configured to pick up and perform a mounting process on the components; the mounting method comprising: (a) a step of picking up a second component later when the mounting head picks up a first component held at a predetermined height and the second component held at a lowered position lower than a predetermined height, and (b) a step of releasing the second component earlier when a component is released from the mounting head having picked up the first component and the second component.", "In this mounting method, similarly to the mounting device described above, the first component and the second component can be picked up, held, and released without interference, and the first component and the second component can be held and moved in the same step, making it possible to further improve the production efficiency.
