<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119 of a Korean patent application number 10-2020-0003206, filed on Jan. 9, 2020, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosures of each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a shielding member for performing an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding function and an electronic device including the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic devices such as smart phones, tablet personal computers (PCs), and computers are becoming smaller, slimmer, and multifunctional.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, electronic components constituting electronic devices are also becoming highly integrated, and a signal processing speed thereof is also increasing. In a process in which electronic components perform signal processing, noise in the form of electromagnetic waves is generated. Noise generated from highly integrated electronic components is a major cause of malfunction or inefficient operation of adjacent electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">EMI shielding may mean technology that guarantees a normal operation of electronic components by blocking noise generated from the electronic components from being transferred to the outside and that protects the electronic components. For example, by using EMI shielding, noise generated from an IC chip may be prevented from being induced to an antenna wiring or an antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a film type shielding member is used for EMI shielding, the shielding member may be attached to a ground line of a printed circuit board. A width of a ground line needs to be sufficiently secured so that the film type shielding member may be stably adhered to the printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In designing the disposition of electronic components included in an electronic device, in consideration of a shielding performance, components having a driving frequency of a similar frequency band are generally disposed adjacent to each other. Thereby, there may be a plurality of areas in which components are mounted in the printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When a plurality of areas is covered with the film type shielding member, a ground line for attaching the shielding member is required between the areas. As described above, the ground line needs to secure a sufficient width. For this reason, a problem may occur that a mounting area of the printed circuit board is reduced because of the ground line formed between the areas.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the disclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a shielding film <b>300</b> according to various embodiments disclosed in the disclosure may be produced in the form of a plate-shaped film. In consideration of ease of shaping of the shielding film <b>300</b>, the shielding film <b>300</b> may be made of a material that can be softened by a heat. The shielding film <b>300</b> may be disposed to cover various electronic components mounted in the printed circuit board <b>210</b>. The shielding film <b>300</b> may be attached to the first ground portion <b>220</b> formed in the printed circuit board <b>210</b>. A width of the first ground portion <b>220</b> may be determined so that the shielding film <b>300</b> may be stably attached to the first ground portion <b>220</b> of the printed circuit board <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to various embodiments, the shielding film <b>300</b> may include a first insulating layer <b>310</b>, a second insulating layer <b>350</b>, and a first shielding layer <b>330</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the shielding film <b>300</b> may be formed by stacking in order of the first insulating layer <b>310</b>, the first shielding layer <b>330</b>, the second insulating layer <b>350</b>. However, such a stacked structure of the shielding film <b>300</b> is only an example, and the stacked structure of the shielding film <b>300</b> may be changed to a form different from that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. For example, the second insulating layer <b>350</b> may be removed in some sections of the shielding film <b>300</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). Further, a second shielding layer (e.g., a second shielding layer <b>370</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>) may be additionally stacked in some sections of the shielding film <b>300</b>. The second shielding layer <b>370</b> may be, for example, stacked between the first shielding layer <b>330</b> and the second insulating layer <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first shielding layer <b>330</b> may shield noise so that noise generated in various electronic components mounted in the printed circuit board <b>210</b> does not leak outside of the shielding film <b>300</b>. The first shielding layer <b>330</b> may include a nanofiber layer <b>331</b> and conductive particles <b>332</b> and <b>333</b>. The conductive particles may include at least one of metal particles <b>332</b> and graphite particles <b>333</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The nanofiber layer <b>331</b> of the first shielding layer <b>330</b> may be made of nanofibers. The nanofibers constituting the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> may be made of various materials. For example, the nanofibers may be made of polyester or polyimide. A thickness of the nanofiber may be 1 um to 20 um. In addition, it is possible to configure the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> with nanofibers of various thicknesses, as needed. The nanofibers may be metal plated so that the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> has electrical conductivity. A thickness of the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> may be 10 um to 20 um. For example, the thickness of the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> may be 15 um. A density of the nanofibers constituting the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> in a thickness range of the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> may be 0.8 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 0.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, in order for the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> to exhibit electrical conductivity, a metal plating treatment may be performed on the nanofiber. When the density of the nanofibers is less than 0.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> may not have sufficient electrical conductivity for noise shielding. When the density of the nanofibers exceeds 0.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, a metal may not be sufficiently plated up to the nanofibers positioned inside the nanofiber layer <b>331</b>. In this case, a current may not sufficiently flow in a direction (Y direction based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) perpendicular to the longitudinal direction (X direction based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) of the nanofiber layer <b>331</b>. When a current does not appropriately flow in a vertical direction of the nanofiber layer <b>331</b>, the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> may be substantially separated into two or more conductive layers. When the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> is separated into two or more conductive layers, resistance may increase and a noise shielding performance may decrease. In some cases, according to the length of the conductive layer separated into two or more, there is a risk of occurrence of a side effect in which noise is amplified because of resonance between noises of each conductive layer. Therefore, it may be preferable that the density of the nanofibers is 0.8 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 0.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The nanofiber layer <b>331</b> made of nanofibers plated within this density range may have electrical conductivity required to shield noise, and because a current flows smoothly in the vertical direction, a phenomenon may be prevented that the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> is separated into two conductive layers. For example, the density of the nanofibers may be 0.86 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to various embodiments of the disclosure, metal plating processing on nanofibers may include coating an electrically conductive polymer material on the nanofibers.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The nanofiber layer <b>331</b> made of flexible nanofibers has a high elastic modulus. The first shielding layer <b>330</b> including the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> may be effectively disposed in a curved portion. Even if stress occurs according to an external force applied to the first shielding layer <b>330</b>, the resulting strain is low; thus, the first shielding layer <b>330</b> may maintain a contact state with the first ground portion <b>220</b>, and there is no fear that cracks occur therein. Therefore, the first shielding layer <b>330</b> including nanofibers may maintain a shielding performance for a long time. For example, the first shielding layer <b>330</b> including the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> made of nanofibers may have an advantage having very high reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The nanofiber layer <b>331</b> may be coated with an adhesive material <b>334</b> so as to exhibit adhesiveness.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The metal particles <b>332</b> and the graphite particles <b>333</b> may be disposed in the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> so as to fill an empty space formed between the nanofibers. After the metal particles <b>332</b> and the graphite particles <b>333</b> are mixed with the adhesive material, when the adhesive material is coated on the nanofiber layer <b>331</b>, the metal particles <b>332</b> and the graphite particles <b>333</b> may be disposed between the nanofibers in a portion coated with an adhesive material. The metal particles <b>332</b> may be particles made of a highly conductive metal such as nickel, aluminum, or copper. The graphite particles <b>333</b> may be particles having a size larger than that of the metal particles <b>332</b>. A volume occupied by the graphite particles <b>333</b> in the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> may be larger than that occupied by the metal particles <b>332</b> in the nanofiber layer <b>331</b>. In this way, the metal particles <b>332</b> and the graphite particles <b>333</b> fill an empty space formed between the nanofibers; thus, electrical conductivity of the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> may be improved. For example, the vertical direction current flow of the nanofiber layer <b>331</b> may be smooth.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The first insulating layer <b>310</b> and the second insulating layer <b>350</b> may electrically block a portion covered by the shielding film <b>300</b> and other portions.

A separation distance L of the conductive member <b>400</b> may be determined based on driving frequencies of electronic components mounted in the first area <b>230</b> of the printed circuit board <b>210</b>. Thereby, it is possible to prevent electromagnetic waves having a driving frequency band of electronic components mounted in the first area <b>230</b> of the printed circuit board <b>210</b> from passing through the conductive members <b>400</b> spaced at predetermined intervals.

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/957,030, filed Jan. 3, 2020, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/957,035, filed Jan. 3, 2020, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a signal received from a natural or man-made external source that is unwanted. Such EMI can and negatively affect the performance of electrical component through electromagnetic induction, electrostatic coupling, or conduction provided thereby. These electronic disturbances can degrade the performance of computing and communication components by increasing the error rates in data transfer and storage. EMI shielding, however, can protect electrical devices from external signal interference, from leaking EMI signals, and to prevent electrical components within an electrical device from interfering with each other. Shielding from EMI is also important to ensure accurate testing and calibration of electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">EMI shields are typically composed of metals or metal composites, due to their high conductivity. However, such metallic components can be difficult to manufacture and are susceptible to chemical corrosions and oxidations, which reduce the shielding effectiveness over time.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disclosed herein are electromagnetic shields or shielding materials that provide numerous advantages over conventional EMI shields. The EMI shields can be used to efficiently dissipate heat and minimize problems associated with EMI interference via its superior electrical and/or thermal properties while also providing excellent mechanical flexibility and structural integrity. Unlike conventional metal foils, the EMI shielding materials disclosed herein are mechanically strong, corrosion resistant and offer processing advantages. In addition to high thermal and electrical conductivity, the EMI shielding materials can be thin, flexible, lightweight, and corrosion resistant. It can also be easy to cut and able to withstand repeated bending in contrast to standard metal-based EMI shielding that are more difficult to cut and can be subject to metal fatigue if subjected to repeated bending.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disclosed herein are methods of manufacturing EMI shields or shielding materials. Compared to conventional EMI shields, the EMI shielding materials of the present disclosure are easier to manufacture and can be prepared at various thicknesses and sizes on different substrates to achieve the desired combination of properties. For example, a thicker and less flexible material may be prepared to allow greater EMI reduction for more sensitive electronics where flexibility is of less importance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the EMI shields or shielding materials are configured to be water resistant and/or waterproof. In some embodiments, the EMI shields or shielding materials are configured to have structural flexibility and/or resilience. In some embodiments, the EMI shields or shielding materials are configured to be scratch resistant. For example, in some embodiments, the EMI shields or shielding materials comprise binders or binder compositions such as carboxylated styrene acrylic latex and/or acrylic.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Current EMI shielding materials employ metals or metal composites for their high conductivity, however such materials can be difficult to process and are susceptible to chemical corrosions and oxidations, resulting in reduced shielding effectiveness over time.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Provided herein are carbon-based electromagnetic interference shielding devices and shielding materials, and preparation methods thereof. The EMI shields and shield coatings herein prevent or reduce RF signals and waves from passing therethrough. In some embodiments, the EMI shielding devices are formed by a coating deposited on a substrate. In some embodiments, the EMI shielding devices are formed with compression molding techniques. The EMI shielding devices can be shaped from one or more sheets. The sheets can be thin, flexible, lightweight, and/or corrosion resistant. The EMI shielding materials can be adapted to provide EMI shielding or filtering according to the desired effect. As an example, an EMI shield can be shaped as an enclosure (e.g., a box shape enclosing sensitive electronics). As another example, EMI shielding materials can be cut into thin, flexible sheets sized to the walls of a room, and then applied to the walls, optionally with an adhesive on one side of the sheets, in order to generate an EMI shielded room. Accordingly, the various advantages of the present disclosure include allowing EMI shielding to be efficiently adapted to devices, rooms, vehicles, or other relevant implementations, even when such implementations were not designed for or even originally contemplate EMI shielding.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Circuit board assemblies are ubiquitously produced for electronic products of a great many varieties. So common are circuit board assemblies, that one would be hard pressed to find a household that had no products containing a circuit board assembly. During the development and manufacture of such circuit board assemblies, various circumstances can result in rework of one of more circuit board assemblies. For example, during product development, rework can be performed to address a problem identified during such a development phase. Such testing can be performed so as to reduce the number of revisions to the production of the circuit boards. During the production phase of a product, rework can be performed on returned detective products. Such rework can be performed so as to replace the faulty product or simply to determine the cause of the fault.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Rework of circuit board assemblies requires careful localization of heating so as not to damage regions of such circuit board assemblies where rework is not desired. Localizing such heat can be difficult in practice, as heat is communicated via radiation, convection, and conduction, all three of which cause local heating to spread to adjacent regions. To reduce the undesirable spread of local heating, rapid heating and cooling techniques can be used. Thus, it would be desirable to find a method of providing local and rapid heating of a part adhesively attached to a circuit board assembly.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Apparatus and associated methods relate to removing an adhesively-attached component from a circuit board assembly. A complementary pair of high-permeability members are positioned on opposite sides of the circuit board assembly about the adhesively-attached component. Then, a magnetic field is induced within the complementary pair of high permeability members via a coil driver generating an AC current in an inductive coil circumscribing a central pedestal of the complementary pair of high-permeability members.

A return path for the magnetic field is provided about a periphery of the adhesively-attached component via a peripheral pedestal</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a component removal tool removing an adhesively-attached component from a circuit board assembly. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, component removal tool <b>10</b> is in the process of removing adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> from circuit board assembly <b>14</b>. Component removal tool <b>10</b> is configured to heat to adhesives that attach adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> from circuit board assembly <b>14</b>, so as to reduce the adhesion of adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> to circuit board assembly <b>14</b>. When such adhesives are heated, the adhesion of adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> to circuit board assembly <b>14</b> can be significant reduced so that removal of adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> from circuit board assembly <b>14</b> is possible. Various types of adhesives can be used to attach adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> to circuit board assembly <b>14</b>. Various solders, metals, and other adhesives are commonly used to attach electronic components to such circuit board assemblies, such as circuit board assembly <b>14</b>. Such various adhesives can be used for conductive connection between leads of adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> and conduction traces of circuit board assembly <b>14</b>. Some adhesives can be used for physical attachment only of adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> and circuit board assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Component removal tool <b>10</b> heats the adhesives used to attach adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> to circuit board assembly <b>14</b> either directly or indirectly using inductive heating techniques, as will be explained in more detail below. Component removal tool <b>10</b> includes coil driver <b>16</b>, inductive coil <b>18</b>, and complementary high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B. Complementary pair of high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B can be positioned on opposite sides of circuit board assembly <b>14</b> about adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>. At least one of complementary pair the of high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B includes central pedestal <b>24</b>T. In the depicted embodiment, top high-permeability member <b>20</b>T includes central pedestal <b>24</b>T. &#x201c;Top&#x201d; here refers to the one of complementary high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B that is situated on the same side of circuit board assembly <b>14</b> as the side that adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> is situated. The term &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; is used to refer to the other one of complementary high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B that is situated on the opposite side of circuit board assembly <b>14</b> as the side that adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> is situated. The terms &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; need not be indicative of a particular orientation of circuit board assembly <b>14</b>. Instead, the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; can be used to distinguish between complementary high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A magnetic field can be induced in complementary high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B via inductive coil <b>16</b> circumscribing central pedestal <b>24</b>T of the complementary pair of high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B. Coil driver <b>18</b> is configured to generate an AC current in inductive coil <b>16</b> circumscribing central pedestal <b>24</b>T, thereby inducing the magnetic field therein. Because high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B are made of high-permeability materials, any magnetic fields induced therein are channeled via the high-permeability members so as to minimize losses to the magnetic field induced. The magnetic field takes the path of &#x201c;least resistance,&#x201d; which is a metaphor for the closed path of highest permeability. By directing the magnetic field, via complementary high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B, complementary high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B shield from magnetic field exposure circuitry outside an interior cavity defined by interior surfaces of high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B. Only the circuitry within such a cavity will be exposed to the magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">At least one of complementary pair the of high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B has a peripheral pedestal. In the depicted embodiment both top and bottom high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B have central pedestals&#x2014;central pedestals <b>26</b>T and <b>26</b>B, respectively. Central pedestal <b>24</b>T is configured to direct a magnetic field induced therein through the adhesively-attached component. Peripheral pedestals <b>26</b>T and <b>26</b>B are configured to provide a return path for the magnetic field about a periphery of the adhesively-attached component.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In operation, complementary high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B are positioned on opposite sides of the circuit board assembly about the adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>. High-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B are positioned in clam-shell fashion so as to substantially enclose adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> within the interior cavity defined by interior surfaces of high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B. A magnetic field is then induced within high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B via AC excitation of inductive coil <b>16</b> by coil driver <b>18</b>. The magnetic field induced is directed through adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> so as to induce AC currents with any conductive material within or below adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>, thereby heating such conductive materials. Any solders, leads, circuit board traces, etc., which are located in this region where the magnetic field is directed will then heat due to these induced AC currents. Such heating can either directly heat the adhesives (e.g., if solder adhesives are located in this region) or indirectly heat the adhesives (e.g., via thermal conduction from the heated conductive materials to the adhesives).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">One the adhesives have been heated, adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> can be removed from circuit board assembly <b>14</b>. Various methods of removing adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> from circuit board assembly <b>14</b> can be employed. For example, top high-permeability member <b>20</b>T can be raised, and adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> can be manually removed using a tool, tweezers, etc. In some embodiments, top high-permeability member <b>20</b>T can be equipped with a suction system to as to vacuum attach top high-permeability member <b>20</b>T to a top surface of adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>. Then, by raising top high-permeability member <b>20</b>T, vacuum attached component <b>12</b> will be removed thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side-elevation view of an embodiment of a component removal tool configured to inductively heat an adhesively-attached component. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, adhesively attached component <b>12</b>, is shown attached to circuit board assembly <b>14</b> via solder balls <b>28</b>. Top high-permeability member <b>20</b>T includes central pedestal <b>24</b>T and peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>T. Bottom high-permeability member <b>20</b>B includes peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>B. Inductive coil <b>16</b> is wound about central pedestal <b>24</b>T. Top high-permeability member <b>20</b>T together with circuit board assembly <b>14</b> forms cavity <b>30</b>, within which adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> is substantially enclosed or encapsulated. Bottom high-permeability member <b>20</b>B is aligned with top high-permeability member <b>20</b>T so as to facilitate maximize the permeability throughout a closed path about and through adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>. Such maximization of the permeability throughout the closed circuit path facilitates high magnetic-field strength, thereby producing high indictive heating of conductive elements that intercept the closed path.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side-elevation view of the component removal tool depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> with the magnetic flux indicated therein. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is annotated with magnetic field lines <b>32</b>. Magnetic field lines <b>32</b> traverse a close path about and through adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>. Magnetic field lines <b>32</b> correspond to a magnetic field induced by an AC current in inductive windings <b>16</b>. Such an AC current in inductive windings <b>16</b> will induce a current in central pedestal <b>24</b>T about which inductive windings are wound. This magnetic field will be directed about inductive windings <b>16</b> in a manner that traverses a path of least magnetic reluctance. Magnetic reluctance is inversely related to magnetic permeability. Thus, the magnetic field lines <b>32</b> will be preferentially directed in a path within high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B, as shown in the figure. Thus, magnetic field lines <b>32</b> traverse a path: i) from central pedestal <b>24</b>T up to lateral field region <b>34</b>T of top high-permeability member <b>20</b>T; ii) then laterally outward from central pedestal <b>24</b>T within lateral field region <b>34</b>T to peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>T; iii) then downward through peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>T through circuit board assembly <b>14</b> to peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>B; iv) then from peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>B to lateral field region <b>34</b>B; v) then laterally inward from peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>B to a central region of bottom high-permeability member <b>20</b>B; vi) then upward through circuit board assembly <b>14</b>, solder balls <b>28</b>, and adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>, and back to central pedestal <b>24</b>T again. Because magnetic field lines traverse circuit board assembly <b>14</b>, solder balls <b>28</b>, and adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>, conductive elements, such as solder balls <b>28</b> within such a magnetic field will be inductively heated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Thus, these lateral field regions <b>34</b>T and <b>34</b>B provide connect any central pedestals <b>24</b>T and <b>24</b>B (if present) with any peripheral pedestals <b>26</b>T and <b>26</b>B (if present), respectively. Furthermore, any central pedestals <b>24</b>T and <b>24</b>B as well as any peripheral pedestals <b>26</b>T and <b>26</b>B extends from such lateral field regions <b>34</b>T and <b>34</b>B, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">This path in which the magnetic field is direction includes an annular region of circuit board assembly <b>14</b> that circumscribes adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> and a central region of adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> and a corresponding adjacent region of circuit board assembly <b>14</b>. This central region through which the magnetic field is directed is proximate and defined by central pedestal <b>24</b>. Peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>T is located between adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> and other devices affixed to the circuit board assembly adjacent to the adhesively-attached components, such as, for example additional component <b>22</b>. Additional component <b>22</b> is shielded from exposure to the magnetic field by complementary high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a plan view of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> embodiment of a component removal tool configured to inductively heat an adhesively-attached component. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, top and bottom high-permeability members <b>20</b>T and <b>20</b>B are depicted in plan view so as to appreciate a lateral extent of an example embodiment. Top high-permeability member <b>20</b>T includes central pedestal <b>24</b>T, peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>T, lateral field region <b>34</b>T, and inductive windings <b>16</b>. In the depicted embodiment, central pedestal <b>24</b>T has a square configuration. In some embodiments, central pedestal can be circular, rectangular or any other geometry appropriate for the specific adhesively-attached component to be extracted. About central pedestal <b>24</b>T are show inductive windings <b>16</b>. In the depicted embodiment, peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>T is an annular pedestal that circumscribes central pedestal <b>24</b>T without interruption. In some embodiments, in which the specific circuit board assembly requires interruption (e.g., due to a component located within the peripheral pedestal region), peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>T can have one or more interruptions in its otherwise annular geometry.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Bottom high-permeability member <b>26</b>B includes peripheral pedestal <b>26</b>B and lateral field region <b>34</b>B only. In other embodiments, bottom high-permeability member <b>26</b>B can have a central pedestal as well as other features. For example, bottom high-permeability member can include an inductive coil, such as inductive coil <b>16</b> either in addition to or instead of inductive coil <b>16</b> wound about central pedestal <b>24</b>T of top high-permeability member <b>20</b>T. In some embodiments, peripheral pedestals <b>26</b>T and <b>26</b>B are complementary such that, when aligned with one another, peripheral pedestals <b>26</b>T and <b>26</b>B are substantially coextensive in their lateral dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side-elevation view of an embodiment of a component removal tool that facilitates both inductive and convective heating. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, adhesively attached component <b>12</b>, is shown attached to circuit board assembly <b>14</b> via solder balls <b>28</b>. Top high-permeability member <b>120</b>T differs from those shown in the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. Top high-permeability member <b>120</b>T is configured both to direct the magnetic field induced by inductive coil <b>16</b>, and to facilitate circulation of heated air into and out of cavity <b>30</b>. To facility the circulation of heated air, top high-permeability member <b>120</b>T includes input apertures <b>40</b>, and output apertures <b>42</b>. Such apertures can be used to provide circulation of heated air within cavity <b>30</b>, which can be produced by a forced air heating system. Input and second apertures are thus configured to provide a circulatory path for convective heating therethrough. For example, a force air heater can force air into input apertures <b>40</b> and then receive air exhausted from output apertures <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side-elevation view of an embodiment of a component removal tool that includes a part extractor using vacuum technology. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, adhesively attached component <b>12</b>, is shown attached to circuit board assembly <b>14</b> via solder balls <b>28</b>. Top high-permeability member <b>220</b>T differs from those shown in the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. Top high-permeability member <b>220</b>T includes part suction port <b>44</b>. Part suction port <b>44</b> is a central aperture from an outside surface of top high-permeability member <b>220</b>T through central pedestal <b>224</b>T. A vacuum system can be fluidly connected to part suction port <b>44</b> so as to provide a suction that can cause central pedestal <b>224</b>T to engage adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>. Then, when solder balls <b>28</b> have melted (e.g., during reflow of the solder balls), top high-permeability member <b>220</b>T can be removed, thereby removing component <b>12</b>, whose melted solder balls <b>28</b> no longer provide adhesive attachment between component <b>12</b> and circuit board assembly <b>14</b>. Part suction port <b>44</b> can be located in various other configurations, such as, for example, adjacent to central pedestal <b>224</b>T. In some embodiments, for example, an annular aperture can circumscribe central pedestal <b>224</b>T so as to provide an annular suction seal with adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a side-elevation view of an embodiment of a component removal tool having a peripheral flux-transmission member, such as peripheral pedestal <b>326</b>T configured to align upon a periphery of a component. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, adhesively attached component <b>12</b>, is shown attached to circuit board assembly <b>14</b> via solder balls <b>28</b>. Both top and bottom high-permeability member <b>320</b>T and <b>320</b>B differ from those shown in the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. Bottom high-permeability member <b>320</b>B includes no central pedestal or peripheral pedestal. Such a bottom high-permeability member, as bottom high-permeability member <b>320</b>B can be used for circuit board assemblies, such as circuit board assembly <b>14</b>, which have a planar surface on the bottom side adjacent to bottom high-permeability member <b>120</b>B. Top high-permeability member <b>320</b>T also differs in that peripheral pedestals <b>326</b>T are configured to direct the magnetic field induced within top high-permeability member <b>320</b>T through an annular periphery of adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>. Thus, instead of directing the magnetic field through only circuit board assembly <b>14</b> in an annular region circumscribing adhesively-attached component <b>12</b>, in the depicted embodiment, the magnetic field is directed through both the adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> and circuit board assembly <b>14</b>. Thus, the magnetic field directed through such an annular region of adhesively-attached component <b>12</b> can provide additional inductive heating of conductive elements located in such an annular region.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">It is an object of the present invention to provide a production system and a control method for the production system that can suppress erroneous mounting when a tape feeder is shared and used even when latest tape feeder information is not shared among multiple production lines in a production system having multiple production lines. Information that matches the tape feeder database stored by the line management device is stored in the tape feeder. When the tape feeder is mounted on the mounting machine, the information stored in the tape feeder is read, and when it is determined that the information does not match the tape feeder database, mounting of the electronic component supplied from the tape feeder is stopped.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates to a production system and a control method of the production system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Patent Literature 1 discloses a production system including a line management device for controlling a work machine and a centralized management apparatus connected to the line management device, and the production system causes the work machine to continue work when a network failure occurs between the centralized management apparatus and the line management device. More specifically, the line management device acquires multiple pieces of control data in advance from the centralized management apparatus, and when a network failure with the centralized management apparatus is detected, the work of the work machine is continued based on the multiple pieces of control data acquired by the line management device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When the work machine is a mounting work machine for mounting an electronic component supplied from a tape feeder to a board, the multiple pieces of control data may include collation information for preventing erroneous mounting. The collation information includes, for example, information on the arrangement of tape feeders in the slots of the mounting work machine and information on the type of electronic components that can be used by the mounting work machine. Further, for the purpose of collating information, it is possible to have a configuration in which the line management device stores tape feeder information in which tape feeder IDs assigned to the tape feeders are linked with IDs of electronic components held by the tape feeders. In this configuration, the collating is done in the following manner. First, when a tape feeder is attached, the mounting work machine acquires the tape feeder ID assigned in advance to the tape feeder and transfers it to the line management device. Next, in the line management device, the tape feeder information is referred to and collated with the electronic component ID linked with the transferred tape feeder ID, and it is determined whether the tape feeder and the electronic component held by the tape feeder are usable. When it is determined that the tape feeder and the electronic component are usable, the mounting work machine performs the mounting work. The tape feeder information is updated, for example, when an electronic component is attached to an empty tape feeder, when an electronic component is spliced to a held electronic component, or the like.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Incidentally, a tape feeder may be moved and used among multiple production lines. For example, when a tape feeder used in a first production line is moved to a second production line and an electronic component is added in the second production line, the tape feeder information stored in the line management device of the second production line is updated. However, when a network failure occurs, the line management device of the first production line cannot update its stored tape feeder information in accordance with the update of the tape feeder information stored in the line management device of the second production line. For this reason, when the tape feeder is returned to the first production line again, collation of collation information is performed on old tape feeder information stored in the line management device of the first production line, which may cause erroneous mounting.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In consideration of the above-described problem, it is an object of the present application to provide a production system and a control method of the production system which can suppress erroneous mounting when a tape feeder is shared and used, in a production system having multiple production lines, even when the latest tape feeder information is not shared among the multiple production lines.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present specification discloses a production system, comprising: multiple production lines, each production line having at least one electronic component mounting machine; a line management device provided in each of the multiple production lines; a tape feeder having a mounting section configured to be mounted with a component tape in which electronic components are accommodated in a carrier tape; and a communication device configured to acquire a tape feeder ID assigned to a tape feeder and a component ID assigned to a component tape when the component tape is mounted in a tape feeder whose mounting section is not mounted with a component tape, and transmit tape feeder information to the line management device of the production line in which mounting is to be performed and said tape feeder, the tape feeder information including acquired tape feeder IDs and component IDs which are linked with each other; wherein each of the line management device and the tape feeder stores the tape feeder information when the tape feeder information from the communication device is transmitted; and the electronic component mounting machine executes a reading process in which the tape feeder information is read from the tape feeder when the tape feeder is mounted; a receiving process in which the tape feeder information read in the reading process, and an inquiry as to whether said tape feeder information and the tape feeder information stored in the line management device match, are transmitted to the line management device of the production line in which the tape feeder is mounted, and the result of said inquiry is received; and a stopping process which stops a mounting of the electronic component supplied by said tape feeder when a non-matching result is received.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present disclosure, even when the latest tape feeder information is not shared among multiple production lines in a production system having multiple production lines, it is possible to suppress erroneous mounting when tape feeders are shared and used.</p>

The number, type, order of arrangement, and the like of the devices (i.e., screen printing machine <b>31</b> and mounting machine <b>32</b>) included in production line <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are examples and are not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Work table <b>51</b> is used for preparing tape feeder <b>70</b>, which will be described later, and has a holding table (not shown) for holding tape feeder <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Line management device <b>4</b> is, for example, a server device for management developed by the manufacturer of the work machine, such as screen printing machine <b>31</b>. The user can manage production line <b>2</b> constituted by screen printing machine <b>31</b> or the like by operating line management device <b>4</b>. Line management device <b>4</b> manages various types of data used in production line <b>2</b> and various types of information to be transmitted to centralized management apparatus <b>6</b>, the details of which will be described later. Line management device <b>4</b> is connected to wide area network WAN, to which centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> is connected, and local network LAN, to which screen printing machine <b>31</b> and the like are connected.</p>

The communication protocol unique to the manufacturer is, for example, a protocol capable of transmitting and receiving data using a TCP/IP protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> is, for example, a server that is installed in a data center of a manufacturing company that manufactures a mounting board with production system <b>1</b> and collectively manages data of production lines <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> in each manufacturing factory in remote locations. Centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> is connected to line management devices <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> of the respective factories via wide area network WAN. Centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> transmits and receives data to and from line management device <b>4</b> via an internet line by, for example, a secure communication protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The network configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example and can be changed as appropriate. For example, centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> and line management device <b>4</b> may be connected to each other via a local network. For example, centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> installed in a management building on the same site as line management device <b>4</b> installed in a manufacturing factory may be connected to each other via a local network.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> stores, for example, production planning data, control data, material data, collation data, quality data, and the like. Production planning data includes, for example, a production start time, a scheduled finish time, control data to be used, and data in which production schedules of production lines <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> to be operated are defined. The control data is data used for controlling each work machine, such as screen printing machine <b>31</b>, mounting machine <b>32</b>, inspection machine <b>33</b>, and reflow machine <b>34</b>, for manufacturing the mounting board.

Tape feeder database <b>125</b> is used to create traceability information included in the quality data indicating which electronic components are mounted on which board.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In production system <b>1</b>, tape feeder database <b>125</b> is created for each production line. On the other hand, tape feeder <b>70</b> is commonly used in multiple production lines. Therefore, a method of mounting electronic components in a mounting machine without erroneous mounting even when tape feeder <b>70</b> is moved and used among multiple production lines will be described next by taking mounting machine <b>32</b> as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, various data of a predetermined period are transmitted from centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> to each of line management devices <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>. Line management device <b>4</b> stores the transmitted various data in HDD <b>124</b>. Similarly, line management device <b>5</b> stores the transmitted various data in its own HDD.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The user prepares reel <b>72</b>, which goes to tape feeder <b>70</b>, on work table <b>51</b>, for example, in a preparation period before the start of manufacturing. The production planning data includes information on which electronic components are to be attached to which tape feeder <b>70</b>. Therefore, the user performs the preparation work according to the production planning data. Here, it is assumed that tape feeder <b>70</b> and reel <b>72</b> are assigned a feeder ID and a component ID, respectively, in advance. In addition, it is assumed that bar code <b>61</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) indicating the assigned feeder ID is affixed to tape feeder <b>70</b>. Similarly, it is assumed that bar code <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) indicating the assigned component ID is affixed to reel <b>72</b>. The user causes bar code reader <b>152</b> to read bar codes <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> during the preparation operation. Bar code reader <b>152</b> transmits the feeder ID and the component ID, which constitute information of the read bar codes <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>, to communication device <b>151</b>. Communication device <b>151</b> transmits tape feeder information <b>143</b>, in which the component ID is linked to the feeder ID acquired by transmission from bar code reader <b>152</b>, to line management device <b>4</b> and tape feeder <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present embodiment, since communication devices such as communication device <b>151</b> are provided for each production line, such as production line <b>2</b>, the user performs preparation work on work table <b>51</b> provided in production line <b>2</b> to which tape feeder <b>70</b> is to be mounted. Therefore, line management device <b>4</b> to which communication device <b>151</b> is connected via local network LAN, and to which communication device <b>151</b> transmits tape feeder information <b>143</b>, is production line <b>2</b> to which tape feeder <b>70</b> is to be mounted. Line management device <b>4</b> updates tape feeder database <b>125</b> based on the transmitted tape feeder information <b>143</b>. More specifically, line management device <b>4</b> adds the transmitted tape feeder information <b>143</b> to tape feeder database <b>125</b> and updates tape feeder information <b>143</b> as information having a &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; of &#x201c;1&#x201d;. When tape feeder information <b>143</b> is received, control circuit <b>141</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> stores the received tape feeder information <b>143</b> in memory section <b>142</b> and sets splicing information <b>146</b> to an initial value of &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Here, splicing information <b>146</b> is information capable of specifying the number of component tapes <b>80</b> mounted on the same production line to which splicing information <b>146</b> belongs.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, when the user splices and adds component tape <b>80</b> to tape feeder <b>70</b>, bar codes <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> are similarly read by bar code reader <b>152</b>. Further, communication device <b>151</b> transmits to line management device <b>4</b> additional information in which the component ID is linked with the feeder ID acquired by being transmitted from bar code reader <b>152</b>. Line management device <b>4</b> updates tape feeder database <b>125</b> based on the transmitted additional information. More specifically, line management device <b>4</b> adds the transmitted additional information to tape feeder database <b>125</b> and updates the value obtained by incrementing the value of the &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; already stored for the corresponding feeder ID of tape feeder database <b>125</b>. That is, the transmitted additional information is stored in tape feeder database <b>125</b> as information of &#x201c;2&#x201d; or later in the &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d;. Further, communication device <b>151</b> transmits the information of the added component ID to tape feeder <b>70</b>. When tape feeder <b>70</b> receives the added component ID information, tape feeder <b>70</b> stores the transmitted component ID information in memory section <b>142</b> as splicing information <b>146</b>. The details of splicing information <b>146</b> stored in memory section <b>142</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, it is assumed that component tape <b>80</b> having the component ID of &#x201c;Z1111&#x201d; is mounted on tape feeder <b>70</b> having the feeder ID of &#x201c;CCC&#x201d; in which component tape <b>80</b> is not mounted on reel mounting section <b>74</b>. In this instance, tape feeder information <b>143</b> in which feeder ID is &#x201c;CCC&#x201d; and component ID is &#x201c;Z1111&#x201d; is transmitted to tape feeder <b>70</b> in which feeder ID is &#x201c;CCC&#x201d;. Tape feeder <b>70</b> stores tape feeder information <b>143</b> in memory section <b>142</b>. Further, as indicated by information <b>201</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, splicing information <b>146</b> is set to &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Next, it is assumed that component tape <b>80</b> having component ID &#x201c;Z2222&#x201d; is spliced and added to component tape <b>80</b> having component ID &#x201c;Z1111&#x201d;. In this instance, tape feeder <b>70</b> having feeder ID of &#x201c;CCC&#x201d; is transmitted with information indicating that component tape <b>80</b> having a component ID of &#x201c;Z2222&#x201d; has been added.

Next, it is assumed that component tape <b>80</b> having the component ID &#x201c;Z2222&#x201d; is spliced and added to component tape <b>80</b> having the component ID &#x201c;Z3333&#x201d;. In this instance, tape feeder <b>70</b> having the feeder ID of &#x201c;CCC&#x201d; is transmitted with information indicating that component tape <b>80</b> having the component ID of &#x201c;Z3333&#x201d; has been added. When the information is transmitted, tape feeder <b>70</b> updates splicing information <b>146</b> to &#x201c;Z2222&#x201d; &#x201c;Z3333&#x201d; as shown in information <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Further, when component tape <b>80</b> is added, tape feeder <b>70</b> similarly adds and updates the component ID of the added component tape <b>80</b> to splicing information <b>146</b>. As described above, splicing information <b>146</b> is information in which the component IDs are spliced, that is, information in which tape feeders <b>70</b> are arranged in the supplying order to mounting machine <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example of tape feeder database <b>125</b> stored in line management device <b>4</b> in the case of the above-described example. The number of rows in which the value of the item &#x201c;feeder ID&#x201d; of tape feeder database <b>125</b> is &#x201c;CCC&#x201d; is 3, which is the same as the number of component tapes <b>80</b> mounted on tape feeder <b>70</b> having the feeder ID &#x201c;CCC&#x201d;. The value of the &#x201c;component ID&#x201d; in each of the three rows is &#x201c;Z1111&#x201d; &#x201c;Z2222&#x201d; &#x201c;Z3333&#x201d;, and the values of the items of the &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; are &#x201c;1&#x201d;, &#x201c;2&#x201d;, and &#x201c;3&#x201d;, respectively. In this manner, for the same feeder ID, the component ID whose value of the &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; of tape feeder database <b>125</b> is &#x201c;1&#x201d; matches the component ID of tape feeder information <b>143</b> stored in tape feeder <b>70</b>. In addition, for the same feeder ID, the component ID whose value of the &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; in tape feeder database <b>125</b> is &#x201c;2&#x201d; or later matches the component ID of splicing information <b>146</b> stored in tape feeder <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When component tape <b>80</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> is depleted by the mounting work of mounting machine <b>16</b>, control circuit <b>141</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> transmits information indicating that component tape <b>80</b> has been depleted to mounting machine <b>16</b>. When mounting machine <b>16</b> receives information indicating the depletion, mounting machine <b>16</b> transfers the information indicating the depletion to line management device <b>4</b>. When line management device <b>4</b> receives information indicating the depletion, the row of feeder ID corresponding to the depleted feeder in tape feeder database <b>125</b>, that is, the row in which the &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, is deleted, and the values of the &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; of the row with the &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; of &#x201c;2&#x201d; or later are decremented to update tape feeder database <b>125</b>. When splicing information <b>146</b> is stored in memory section <b>142</b>, control circuit <b>141</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> updates tape feeder information <b>143</b> by using component ID stored as splicing information <b>146</b> as component ID <b>145</b> of tape feeder information <b>143</b>, and deletes first component ID of splicing information <b>146</b>. On the other hand, when splicing information <b>146</b> is not stored in memory section <b>142</b>, control circuit <b>141</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> deletes component ID <b>145</b> of tape feeder information <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, even when component tape <b>80</b> is spliced and added by the user in a state where tape feeder <b>70</b> is mounted in slot <b>108</b> of mounting machine <b>32</b>, tape feeder information <b>143</b> and splicing information <b>146</b> stored in memory section <b>142</b> are updated. Similar to the preparation work, when the user splices and adds component tape <b>80</b> to tape feeder <b>70</b>, the user assigns a number to slot <b>108</b>, which will be described later, and causes bar codes <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> to be read by a bar code reader (not shown). The bar code reader transmits the number of the specified slot <b>108</b> and the read feeder ID and component ID to mounting machine <b>32</b>. When mounting machine <b>32</b> receives the number of the specified slot <b>108</b> and the read feeder ID and component ID, mounting machine <b>32</b> transmits the component ID to tape feeder <b>70</b> mounted in the number of the specified slot <b>108</b>. Control circuit <b>141</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> stores the transmitted information of the component ID in memory section <b>142</b> as splicing information <b>146</b>. In addition, mounting machine <b>32</b> transmits to line management device <b>4</b> information in which the component ID is linked to the transmitted feeder ID. When line management device <b>4</b> receives the information in which the component ID is linked with the feeder ID, line management device <b>4</b> updates tape feeder database <b>125</b> in the same manner as in the case in which additional information is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, the collation process executed by CPU <b>131</b> of mounting machine <b>32</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The CPU included in mounting machine <b>36</b> also executes the collation process. The multiple slots <b>108</b> included in tape feeder holding stand <b>100</b> are assigned numbers in advance in order to enable identification of positions. The collation data includes information indicating in which slot <b>108</b>, among the multiple slots <b>108</b>, tape feeder <b>70</b> holding component tape <b>80</b> should be placed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When CPU <b>131</b> determines that tape feeder <b>70</b> is mounted in slot <b>108</b> based on the detector output signals, the collation process is initiated. First, in step S<b>1</b>, CPU <b>131</b> causes second interface <b>135</b> to read tape feeder information <b>143</b> and splicing information <b>146</b> stored in memory section <b>142</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b>. When CPU <b>131</b> reads out tape feeder information <b>143</b> and splicing information <b>146</b> via second interface <b>135</b>, CPU <b>131</b> transmits signals to line management device <b>4</b> requesting collation of tape feeder information <b>143</b> and splicing information <b>146</b> (S<b>3</b>). When CPU <b>121</b> of line management device <b>4</b> receives the signal requesting collation, line management device <b>4</b> determines whether the received tape feeder information <b>143</b> and splicing information <b>146</b> match with stored tape feeder database <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">More specifically, CPU <b>121</b> extracts a row that matches the values of the received feeder ID in tape feeder database <b>125</b>. Next, CPU <b>121</b> determines whether the component ID of &#x201c;1&#x201d; in the &#x201c;supply order&#x201d; among extracted rows matches the component ID of the received tape feeder information <b>143</b>. When CPU <b>121</b> determines that the component ID whose &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; is &#x201c;1&#x201d; matches the component ID of the received tape feeder information <b>143</b>, CPU <b>121</b> then determines whether each of the component IDs whose &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; is &#x201c;2&#x201d; and later matches each of the component IDs of the received splicing information <b>146</b>. If it is determined that each of the component IDs having a &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; of &#x201c;2&#x201d; or later matches each of the component IDs of the received splicing information <b>146</b>, CPU <b>121</b> determines that the received splicing information matches tape feeder database <b>125</b>. On the other hand, in the case that CPU <b>121</b> determines that the component ID having the &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; of &#x201c;1&#x201d; does not match the component ID of the received tape feeder information <b>143</b> and determines that the component ID having the &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; of &#x201c;2&#x201d; or later does not match the component ID of the received splicing information <b>146</b>, CPU <b>121</b> determines that the component ID does not match tape feeder database <b>125</b>. When the feeder ID of the received tape feeder information <b>143</b> is not recorded in tape feeder database <b>125</b>, CPU <b>121</b> determines that the ID does not match with tape feeder database <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Here, when it is determined that CPU <b>121</b> does not match, the following cases are assumed. One is a case where component tape <b>80</b> is mounted in empty tape feeder <b>70</b> on which component tape <b>80</b> is not mounted, for example, in production line <b>3</b>, which is different from production line <b>2</b> in which the collation process is executed, and is a case in which tape feeder information <b>143</b> and splicing information <b>146</b> stored in memory section <b>142</b> are stored. Further, for example, tape feeder <b>70</b> used in production line <b>2</b> is moved to production line <b>3</b> by the user, and a new component tape <b>80</b> is spliced in production line <b>3</b>. As described above, when an inconsistency is determined in step S<b>5</b>, it is considered that component tape <b>80</b> actually mounted on tape feeder <b>70</b> does not match the information of tape feeder database <b>125</b> stored in line management device <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">CPU <b>121</b> of line management device <b>4</b> transmits a signal indicating &#x201c;match&#x201d; when it is determined that mounting machine <b>16</b> which requested collation is consistent, and CPU <b>121</b> transmits a signal indicating &#x201c;non-match&#x201d; when it is determined that mounting machine <b>16</b> is inconsistent. After executing step S<b>3</b>, CPU <b>131</b> determines whether tape feeder information <b>143</b> and splicing information <b>146</b> transmitted to line management device <b>4</b> match tape feeder database <b>125</b> stored in line management device <b>4</b> (S<b>5</b>). When a signal indicating a consistency is transmitted from line management device <b>4</b>, CPU <b>131</b> determines that a match occurs (S<b>5</b>: YES), and when a signal indicating an inconsistency is transmitted from the line management device <b>4</b>, CPU <b>131</b> determines that a match does not occur (S<b>5</b>: NO).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If it is determined that the electronic components are matched (S<b>5</b>: YES), CPU <b>131</b> determines that the mounting of electronic components supplied from mounted tape feeder <b>70</b> is to be performed (S<b>7</b>) and ends the collation process. On the other hand, if it is determined that the electronic components are not matched (S<b>5</b>: NO), CPU <b>131</b> determines that mounting of electronic components supplied from mounted tape feeder <b>70</b> is not to be performed and stops the mounting of supplied electronic components (S<b>9</b>). Next, a message prompting collation, such as &#x201c;Please re-register the tape feeder&#x201d; is displayed on operation device <b>29</b> (S<b>11</b>), for example, and the collation process is terminated. By displaying the resume-collation message, the user becomes aware that tape feeder database <b>125</b> stored in line management device <b>4</b> and component tape <b>80</b> actually mounted on tape feeder <b>70</b> are different from each other. Here, collation and registration constitute a series of operations in which tape feeder database <b>125</b> is updated by, for example, causing bar code reader <b>152</b> to read bar codes <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>, same as when preparation work is performed during the preparation period described above.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">After performing S<b>7</b>, CPU <b>131</b> transmits to line management device <b>4</b> signals requesting line management device <b>4</b> to collate the number of slot <b>108</b> and the feeder ID with the collation data. Line management device <b>4</b> extracts the value of the component ID that matches the feeder ID transmitted from tape feeder database <b>125</b>, and determines whether the value of the extracted component ID and the number of slot <b>108</b> match with the collation data. As a result, it is determined whether component tape <b>80</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> attached to mounting machine <b>36</b> of the transmitting source is mounted in slot <b>108</b> having the same number as the collation data, whether component tape <b>80</b> can be used in mounting machine <b>36</b>, and the like. If it is determined that line management device <b>4</b> is consistent, line management device <b>4</b> sends a signal indicating usability to mounting machine <b>32</b>. Upon receiving a signal indicating the availability from line management device <b>4</b>, mounting machine <b>32</b> performs mounting work of an electronic component supplied from tape feeder <b>70</b>. Line management device <b>4</b> transmits the value of the component ID extracted from tape feeder database <b>125</b> at the same time as transmitting the signal indicating availability. Mounting machine <b>32</b> stores the transmitted component ID values in RAM <b>132</b> in association with the corresponding feeder IDs.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In step S<b>7</b> of the matching process, when component tape <b>80</b> mounted on tape feeder <b>70</b> matches with tape feeder database <b>125</b>, matching with the matching data is performed. As described above, since component tape <b>80</b> actually mounted on tape feeder <b>70</b> is compared with the matching data, erroneous mounting, for example, which may occur when comparing with tape feeder database <b>125</b> without having the latest tape feeder information, is suppressed. As described above, tape feeder database <b>125</b> is information used for creating traceability information. By using tape feeder database <b>125</b> used for creating traceability information, it is possible to perform a matching process for determining whether tape feeder database <b>125</b> matches component tape <b>80</b> actually mounted on tape feeder <b>70</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to the embodiment described above, the following effects are obtained. When component tape <b>80</b> is mounted on tape feeder <b>70</b>, to which component tape <b>80</b> is not yet mounted on reel mounting section <b>74</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b>, communication device <b>151</b> acquires from bar code reader <b>152</b>, the feeder ID, being provided to tape feeder <b>70</b>, and the component ID, being provided to component tape <b>80</b>, and transmits tape feeder information <b>143</b>, in which the acquired component ID is linked to the acquired feeder ID, to line management device <b>4</b> of production line <b>2</b>, to which the component tape is to be mounted, as well as to tape feeder <b>70</b>. When tape feeder information <b>143</b> is transmitted from communication device <b>151</b>, line management device <b>4</b> adds tape feeder information <b>143</b> to tape feeder database <b>125</b> and stores tape feeder information <b>143</b>. When tape feeder information <b>143</b> is transmitted from communication device <b>151</b>, tape feeder <b>70</b> stores tape feeder information <b>143</b> in memory section <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When tape feeder <b>70</b> is mounted, CPU <b>131</b> of mounting machine <b>32</b> reads out tape feeder data <b>143</b> from tape feeder <b>70</b> in step S<b>1</b>.

In step S<b>5</b>, the result of mismatching is received, and when it is determined that mismatching has occurred, mounting work of electronic components supplied from tape feeder <b>70</b> is stopped in step S<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A case, in which tape feeder information <b>143</b> stored in tape feeder <b>70</b> and tape feeder database <b>125</b> do not match, may be a case where tape feeder <b>70</b>, in which component tape <b>80</b> is mounted in another production line, is mounted on mounting machine <b>32</b>. In such a case, since the collation with the collation data is likely to be performed in tape feeder database <b>125</b> without having the latest tape feeder information stored in line management device <b>4</b>, erroneous mounting can be suppressed by stopping the mounting of the electronic component supplied from tape feeder <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When component tape <b>80</b> is added by splicing to tape feeder <b>70</b> to which component tape <b>80</b> has already been mounted on reel mounting section <b>74</b>, communication device <b>151</b> acquires from bar code reader <b>152</b> the feeder ID of tape feeder <b>70</b> and the component ID of the added component tape <b>80</b>, and transmits additional information, in which the acquired feeder ID is linked to the acquired component ID, to line management device <b>4</b> of production line <b>2</b> to which component tape <b>80</b> is to be mounted. In addition, information of the added component ID, which is information indicating that component tape <b>80</b> has been added, is transmitted to tape feeder <b>70</b>. When the additional information is transmitted from communication device <b>151</b>, line management device <b>4</b> adds and stores the additional information in tape feeder database <b>125</b>. When the information of the added component ID is transmitted from communication device <b>151</b>, tape feeder <b>70</b> updates splicing information <b>146</b> based on the information of the added component ID. Therefore, tape feeder database <b>125</b> stored in line management device <b>4</b> matches the information stored in memory section <b>142</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> in which splicing information <b>146</b> has been updated by communication device <b>151</b> of the same production line. In other words, when tape feeder <b>70</b> whose splicing information <b>146</b> has been updated in another production line is mounted on mounting machine <b>32</b>, tape feeder database <b>125</b> of line management device <b>4</b> of the mounted production line does not match splicing information <b>146</b> stored in the mounted tape feeder <b>70</b>. Therefore, the case where component tapes <b>80</b> are not aligned is, for example, a case where tape feeder <b>70</b> to which component tapes <b>80</b> are added in another production line is mounted on mounting machine <b>32</b>. In such a case, since the collation with the collation data is likely to be performed in tape feeder database <b>125</b> without having the latest tape feeder information stored in line management device <b>4</b>, erroneous mounting can be suppressed by stopping the mounting of the electronic component supplied from tape feeder <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the information of the added component ID is transmitted, tape feeder <b>70</b> stores the transmitted component ID as splicing information <b>146</b>. The component ID of added component tape <b>80</b> can be used as splicing information.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In step S<b>11</b>, CPU <b>131</b> displays a message on operation device <b>29</b> to prompt resuming of collation. Thus, the user can recognize that tape feeder database <b>125</b> needs to be updated.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, another example of splicing information <b>146</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. In the above description, the case where splicing information <b>146</b> is configured by the component ID has been described, but splicing information <b>146</b> may be configured by the number of times of splicing.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Specifically, for example, it is assumed that component tape <b>80</b> having the component ID of &#x201c;Z1111&#x201d; is mounted on tape feeder <b>70</b> having the feeder ID of &#x201c;CCC&#x201d; in which component tape <b>80</b> is not mounted on reel mounting section <b>74</b>. In this case, similarly to the above, splicing information <b>146</b> is set to &#x201c;0&#x201d; as shown by information <b>301</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Next, it is assumed that component tape <b>80</b> having component ID &#x201c;Z2222&#x201d; is spliced and added to component tape <b>80</b> having component ID &#x201c;Z1111&#x201d;. In this case, tape feeder <b>70</b> updates splicing information <b>146</b> to &#x201c;1&#x201d; as indicated by information <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Next, it is assumed that component tape <b>80</b> having the component ID &#x201c;Z2222&#x201d; is spliced and added to component tape <b>80</b> having the component ID &#x201c;Z3333&#x201d;. In this case, tape feeder <b>70</b> updates splicing information <b>146</b> to &#x201c;2&#x201d; as indicated by information <b>303</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. As described above, since the value of splicing information <b>146</b> is incremented each time component tape <b>80</b> is added, splicing information <b>146</b> is a number indicating the number of times of splicing.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this configuration, when the user splices and adds component tape <b>80</b> to tape feeder <b>70</b>, communication device <b>151</b> transmits information to tape feeder <b>70</b> indicating that component tape <b>80</b> has been added (an example of second additional information) to communication interface <b>147</b>. When tape feeder <b>70</b> receives the information indicating that component tape <b>80</b> has been added, tape feeder <b>70</b> increments the value of splicing information <b>146</b>. When component tape <b>80</b> is spliced and added by the user while tape feeder <b>70</b> is mounted in slot <b>108</b> of mounting machine <b>32</b>, the bar code reader transmits the number of the specified slot <b>108</b> and the read feeder ID and component ID to mounting machine <b>32</b> as in the above embodiment. When mounting machine <b>32</b> receives the number of the specified slot <b>108</b> and the read feeder ID and component ID, it transmits information indicating that component tape <b>80</b> has been added to tape feeder <b>70</b> mounted in the number of the specified slot <b>108</b>. When control circuit <b>141</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> receives information indicating that component tape <b>80</b> has been added, control circuit <b>141</b> increments the value of splicing information <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When component tape <b>80</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> is depleted by the mounting work of mounting machine <b>16</b>, control circuit <b>141</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> transmits information indicating that component tape <b>80</b> has been depleted to mounting machine <b>16</b>. When mounting machine <b>16</b> receives information indicating the depletion, if a component ID whose supply order is &#x201c;2&#x201d; is stored, mounting machine <b>16</b> transmits the stored component ID whose supply order is &#x201c;2&#x201d; to tape feeder <b>70</b>. As described above, since mounting machine <b>32</b> stores the value of the component ID transmitted together with the signal indicating usability transmitted from line management device <b>4</b> at the time of matching with the matching data, mounting machine <b>32</b> transmits the component ID in which the stored supply order is &#x201c;2&#x201d;. When the component ID is transmitted from mounting machine <b>32</b>, control circuit <b>141</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> updates tape feeder information <b>143</b> by using the transmitted component ID as component ID <b>145</b> of tape feeder information <b>143</b>. When the value of splicing information <b>146</b> is 1 or more, control circuit <b>141</b> of tape feeder <b>70</b> decrements the value of splicing information <b>146</b> and updates splicing information <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The component ID is information for specifying, for example, a manufacturer, a component type, and the like, and is composed of multiple numbers, letters, and the like, and therefore, the amount of information is more than &#x201c;the number of times of splicing&#x201d; which is a one-digit number. Therefore, with the configuration of another example of the splicing information described above, since the amount of information stored in memory section <b>142</b> is smaller than the component ID, the capacity of memory section <b>142</b> and the processing time for memory section <b>142</b> to store the information can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It is needless to say that the present disclosure is not limited to the above-described embodiments, and various modifications and changes can be made within a scope not departing from the spirit of the present disclosure. For example, in the above description, it has been described that centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> transmits various data of a predetermined period to line management device <b>4</b>. In addition, for example, when line management device <b>4</b> updates tape feeder database <b>125</b>, production system <b>1</b> may transmit the update information to centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> each time, and centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> may transmit the update information to another line management device. Alternatively, for example, line management device <b>4</b> may periodically transmit the update information. In the case of such a configuration, for example, when a communication failure has not occurred in wide area network WAN, the latest tape feeder database shared by multiple line management devices is stored. For example, even in a state where a communication failure occurs in wide area network WAN and the line management device is not updated to the latest tape feeder database, erroneous mounting can be suppressed by executing the matching process. Alternatively, when it is determined in step S<b>5</b> of the matching process that there is no match, the line management device may request centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> to transmit the update information. In this configuration, when the request for transmission of update information is received, centralized management apparatus <b>6</b> may transmit a signal instructing transmission of update information to multiple line management devices.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, in the above description, production system <b>1</b> has been described in which each of the production lines such as production line <b>2</b> includes a work table such as work table <b>51</b>, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. For example, one work table may be provided for multiple production lines. In this case, which of the multiple production lines tape feeder <b>70</b> will be mounted on, that is, which production line is scheduled to perform mounting, may be inputted by a user, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, in the above description, tape feeder information <b>143</b> and splicing information <b>146</b> have been described separately in the case where component tape <b>80</b> is mounted on the empty tape feeder <b>70</b> to which component tape <b>80</b> is not mounted and in the case where component tape <b>80</b> is added to tape feeder <b>70</b> to which component tape <b>80</b> is already mounted. For example, when multiple component tapes <b>80</b> are mounted on tape feeder <b>70</b> at the same time, communication device <b>151</b> may acquire multiple component IDs from bar code reader <b>152</b> and transmit to line management device <b>4</b> a grouping of information in which the acquired feeder IDs are linked to acquired component IDs in the supplying order.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the above description, operation device <b>29</b> is exemplified as the notification section, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. For example, in the case where line management device <b>4</b> is configured to include a display, information for prompting matching may be displayed on the display of line management device <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the above description, the matching with the matching data is performed after the execution of step S<b>7</b> of the matching process, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. For example, when line management device <b>4</b> determines that the received tape feeder information <b>143</b> and splicing information <b>146</b> match the stored tape feeder database <b>125</b> in step S<b>3</b> of the matching process, line management device <b>4</b> may perform matching with the matching data based on tape feeder database <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the above description, line management device <b>4</b> performs matching with the matching data, but the present disclosure is not limited to this, and mounting machine <b>32</b> may be configured to perform matching with the matching data. More specifically, mounting machine <b>32</b> may be configured to store collation data, transmit the component IDs based on tape feeder database <b>125</b> from line management device <b>4</b>, and perform the collation between the transmitted component IDs and the collation data.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Although tape feeder <b>70</b> has been described as storing tape feeder information <b>143</b> in which component ID <b>145</b> is linked with feeder ID <b>144</b>, tape feeder <b>70</b> may be configured to store each of the feeder ID and the component ID.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The configuration of tape feeder database <b>125</b> is not limited to the above. For example, instead of the supplying order, the arrangement of component IDs may be identified by, for example, the date and time when information, such as the tape feeder information, is transmitted from mounting machine <b>32</b>. In addition, line management device <b>4</b> has been described as deleting the row whose &#x201c;supplying order&#x201d; for the corresponding feeder ID of tape feeder database <b>125</b> is &#x201c;1&#x201d; when it receives information indicating depletion, but alternatively depletion may be determined without deletion, for example, by relying on the date and time when information indicating depletion was received.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This specification discloses a mounting device, an information processing device, a mounting method, and an information processing method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, a device having a rotary head has been proposed as a mounting device in which multiple pick-up nozzles are circumferentially attached to a rotary body, and while the rotary body rotates, the rotary head picks up components at a first position and a second position (see, for example, Patent Literature 1). Since components can be picked up at multiple positions, throughput is improved with this device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Patent Literature</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Literature 1: U.S. Pat. No. 6,177,342</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the mounting device of Patent Literature 1, picking up a large-sized component, such as interfering with an adjacent pick-up nozzle or a component picked up by an adjacent nozzle, was not considered. In Patent Literature 1, throughput is improved by picking up components at multiple positions, but this is still not sufficient, and there has been a demand to improve the production efficiency when such large components are picked up.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present disclosure to provide a mounting device, an information processing device, a mounting method, and an information processing method capable of further improving production efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The mounting device, the information processing device, the mounting method, and the information processing method disclosed in this specification adopt the following means to achieve the main object described above.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The mounting device disclosed in this specification comprises: a mounting head having multiple pickup members configured to pick up components; a mounting control section configured to cause a second component to be picked up later when a first component, held by the mounting head at a predetermined height, and the second component, held by the mounting head at a lowered position lower than the predetermined height, are picked up with the mounting head; while to cause the second component to be released earlier when the mounting head, having picked up the first component and the second component, releases a component.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This mounting device causes a second component to be picked up later when a first component, held by the mounting head at a predetermined height, and the second component, held by the mounting head at a lowered position lower than the predetermined height, are picked up by the mounting head; and the mounting control section causes the second component to be released earlier when the mounting head, having picked up the first component and the second component, releases a component. In this mounting device, since the second component is held at a lowered position, it is possible to prevent interference with an adjacent pickup member, a first component picked up by an adjacent pickup member, or the like. Therefore, for example, the first component and the second component larger than the first component can be held and moved in the same step. Further, picking up the second component first may interfere with picking up the first component, but here, since the second component is picked up after the first component, the first component and the second component can be picked up without interference. Similarly, picking up a nearby first component while second component is held may cause interference with the second component, but here, since the second component is released preferentially, the first component and the second component can be released without interference. As described above, in this mounting device, since the first component and the second component can be picked up, held, and released without interference, the production efficiency can be further improved. Here, the &#x201c;predetermined height&#x201d; and the &#x201c;lowered position&#x201d; may be, for example, determined empirically to have heights that do not interfere with other members while components are held. The &#x201c;pickup member&#x201d; may be a pick-up nozzle that picks up a component by pressure, or may be a mechanical chuck that grasps and picks up a component.</p>

Pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> are pickup members configured to pick up a component by making use of negative pressure or a vacuum and are detachably attached to mounting head <b>22</b> via corresponding nozzle holders <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Mounting head <b>22</b> is configured as a rotary-type working head that rotatably holds holding body <b>23</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, holding body <b>23</b> of mounting head <b>22</b> includes head main body <b>40</b> attached to X-axis slider, and engagement shaft <b>41</b> disposed below head main body <b>40</b>. Holding body <b>23</b> includes rotary portion <b>42</b>, which is a cylindrical member, R-axis gear <b>43</b>, which is disposed below rotary portion <b>42</b>, Q-axis gear <b>44</b>, which is disposed above rotary portion <b>42</b>, and multiple long cylindrical nozzle holders <b>24</b> to which pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> are attached at their lower ends. Head main body <b>40</b> is provided with R-axis motor <b>26</b> for rotating rotary portion <b>42</b>, Q-axis motor <b>27</b> for rotating pick-up nozzle <b>25</b>, and Z-axis motor <b>28</b> for moving the push-down portion <b>29</b> to raise and lower pick-up nozzle <b>25</b>. The rotation axis of rotary portion <b>42</b> is referred to as the R-axis, and the rotation axis of each pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> is referred to as a Q-axis. Engagement shaft <b>41</b> is rotatably disposed in head main body <b>40</b> and is inserted into a bottomed hole, formed at the center of Q-axis gear <b>44</b>, to engage with holding body <b>23</b>. Rotary portion <b>42</b> is, for example, a cylindrical member configured to rotate about the center axis of nozzle holders <b>24</b> and support multiple nozzle holders <b>24</b> in an up-down movable manner. R-axis gear <b>43</b> is a disk-shaped member having an outer diameter larger than the diameter of rotary portion <b>42</b>, with gear grooves formed on the outer peripheral surface, R-axis gear <b>43</b> engages with small gear <b>45</b> connected to the rotation shaft of R-axis motor <b>26</b> and is rotationally driven by R-axis motor <b>26</b> via small gear <b>45</b>. Q-axis gear <b>44</b> is a cylindrical member having an outer diameter smaller than the diameter of rotary portion <b>42</b>, with gear grooves formed on the outer peripheral surface. Nozzle holder <b>24</b> is a member in which small gear <b>46</b> is disposed on the upper end and pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> is attached to the lower end. Small gear <b>46</b> engages with gear grooves on the outer periphery of Q-axis gear <b>44</b>. Nozzle holders <b>24</b> are arranged at equal intervals along the outer periphery of Q-axis gear <b>44</b>. Nozzle holder <b>24</b> rotates about its rotation axis (Q-axis) by the driving force of Q-axis motor <b>27</b> transmitted through small gear <b>47</b>, connected to Q-axis motor <b>27</b>, Q-axis gear <b>44</b>, and small gear <b>46</b>, disposed on the upper end of each nozzle holder <b>24</b>, and the angle of the picked up component P can be adjusted. In mounting head <b>22</b>, all nozzle holders <b>24</b> rotate in synchronization with the rotation of Q-axis gear <b>44</b>. Nozzle holder <b>24</b> is moved up and down in the Z-axis direction by the driving force of Z-axis motor <b>28</b> transmitted through push-down portion <b>29</b>. In mounting head <b>22</b>, nozzle holder <b>24</b> is lifted and lowered in the Z-axis direction at two positions (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>): first lifting/lowering position A located at the left end and second lifting/lowering position B located at the right end in the X-axis direction, That is, mounting head <b>22</b> has two lowered positions for lowering pick-up nozzles <b>25</b>. Mounting head <b>22</b> can pick up multiple components P from component supply section <b>14</b> in the same step with multiple pick-up nozzles <b>25</b>. It should be noted that &#x201c;in the same step&#x201d; means, for example, a step in which mounting head <b>22</b> picks up one or more components P, arranges (and discards) components P, and moves to the next pickup position.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, mounting control section <b>30</b> is configured as a microprocessor with CPU <b>31</b> at its center as a control section and includes storage section <b>32</b> for storing various data. Mounting control section <b>30</b> outputs control signals to board processing section <b>12</b>, component supply section <b>14</b>, component imaging section <b>16</b>, and mounting section <b>20</b>, and receives signals from mounting section <b>20</b>, component supply section <b>14</b>, and component imaging section <b>16</b>. Storage section <b>32</b> stores mounting condition information <b>33</b> including the order of picking up and releasing components P, component types (ID), pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> to be used, positioning coordinates, and information on whether holding at a lowered position is necessary. Since mounting condition information <b>33</b> is acquired from management PC <b>50</b> and stored in storage section <b>32</b>, the content is the same as the content of mounting condition information <b>55</b> of management PC <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Management PC <b>50</b> is a computer that manages data of each device of mounting system <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, management PC <b>50</b> includes control device <b>51</b>, storage section <b>53</b>, a display, and an inputting device. Control device <b>51</b> is configured as a microprocessor with CPU <b>52</b> at its center serving as a control section. Storage section <b>53</b> is a device, such as an HDD, for storing various data such as a processing program. The display is a liquid crystal screen for displaying various types of information. The input device includes a keyboard, a mouse, and the like through which an operator inputs various commands. Storage section <b>53</b> stores component information <b>54</b> and mounting condition information <b>55</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, component information <b>54</b> is information linked to the component type (ID), and includes various information, such as the size and type of the component handled by mounting device <b>11</b>, the type of pick-up nozzle for being available, and information on necessity of holding a component at a lowered position. Mounting condition information <b>55</b> is a mounting job used for the mounting process of component P and includes content equivalent to the content of mounting condition information <b>33</b> described above.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Next, the operation of mounting system <b>10</b> of the present embodiment configured as described above, in particular, the state in which mounting head <b>22</b> holds components P will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram showing an example in which general-purpose component P<b>1</b> and large-sized component Pa are picked up. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram showing pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> holding general-purpose component P<b>1</b> at reference height H<b>1</b> (a predetermined height), which is a reference height for holding components P in a normal manner, and large-sized component Pa at lowered position H<b>2</b>. Mounting device <b>11</b> performs, with mounting head <b>22</b>, a process of picking up general-purpose component P<b>1</b> (first component) and large-sized component Pa (second component) in the same step and positioning them on board S. Here, general-purpose component P<b>1</b> and large-sized component Pa are collectively referred to as components P, Reference height H<b>1</b> and lowered position H<b>2</b> may be, for example, determined empirically to have heights that do not interfere with other members while components P are held. General-purpose component P<b>1</b> has, for example, a size and a shape that does not interfere with adjacent pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> or components P while general-purpose component P<b>1</b> is being picked up by pick-up nozzle <b>25</b>. In mounting head <b>22</b>, all of components P being held rotate synchronously about the central axis of the pick-up nozzles <b>25</b>. Therefore, in mounting head <b>22</b>, as shown by the dotted circle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, care is taken so that each component does not interfere with rotation regions obtained by adding a predetermined margin to the component size of each component. Large-sized component Pa is, for example, a component having a size that interferes with the tip of adjacent pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> and/or component P held at the tip of adjacent pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> when large-sized component Pa is picked up by pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> and held at reference height Hi. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, large-sized component Pa is set as a lowered-position held component held at lowered position H<b>2</b> lower than reference height H<b>1</b>, and information of &#x201c;necessary&#x201d; is given to lowered-position held of component information <b>54</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). In the mounting device, large-sized component Pa was not held in the same step as general-purpose component P<b>1</b>, but in mounting device <b>11</b>, as many components P as possible are held in the same step.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Next, the operation of mounting system <b>10</b> of the present embodiment configured as described above, in particular, the process of picking up components P and setting the placement order of components P in management PC <b>50</b> will be described. Here, details of the operation is described in view of a case where eight pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> can be attached to mounting head <b>22</b>, and lowered position at which component P can be picked up is &#x201c;Position <b>2</b>&#x201d;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart showing an example of a mounting-condition setting process routine executed by CPU <b>52</b> of management PC <b>50</b>. This routine is stored in storage section <b>53</b> and executed based on an operator's mounting-condition creation start input. When this routine is started, CPU <b>52</b> first acquires information on components P mounted on board S by mounting device <b>11</b> and provisionally sets the placement order of components P based on a predetermined priority order (S<b>100</b>). For example, CPU <b>52</b> may specify components P from information of board S to be produced, such as CAD data, and acquire information for each component P. Further, the predetermined priority order may be determined by prioritizing one or more of the followings based on experience, such as multiple components P that can be simultaneously picked up, components P which result in a shorter moving distance of mounting head <b>22</b>, components P yielding a smaller number of exchanges of pick-up nozzles <b>25</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Next, CPU <b>52</b> selects component P in order from the top of the provisionally set placement order (S<b>110</b>), and determines whether the selected component P is a lowered-position held component (S<b>120</b>). CPU <b>52</b> determines whether the component is a lowered-position held component based on the lowered-position held information included in component information <b>54</b>. If selected component P is not a lowered-position held component, CPU <b>52</b> determines whether pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> at another position is available to pick up the component in the same step (S<b>150</b>), and if a pick-up nozzle is available to pick up the component, executes S<b>110</b> and subsequent processes. That is, the components are selected until there is no pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> available to perform a pick up, and the maximum number of components P that can be picked up in the same step is set. When the step includes large-sized component Pa, components P cannot be held by the two adjacent pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), in which case, CPU <b>52</b> determines that the maximum number of pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> that can be picked up is <b>6</b>. On the other hand, when component P is a lowered-position held component in S<b>120</b>, CPU <b>52</b> determines whether a lowered position is available (S<b>130</b>). In mounting head <b>22</b>, the lowered position is &#x201c;Position <b>2</b>&#x201d;, and two pick-up nozzles <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>can be lowered at the same time. This determination is made so as not to set lowered-position held components exceeding the number of lowered positions in the same step. When a lowered position is available, CPU <b>52</b> performs S<b>150</b> and subsequent processes. On the other hand, when a lowered position is not available, CPU <b>52</b> removes the selected component from the same step, performs a process of incorporating the selected component into a later step (S<b>140</b>), and performs the process of S<b>150</b> and subsequent processes,</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When other positions are not available in S<b>150</b>, CPU <b>52</b> determines that the number of components that can be held in the same step is maximized, and performs a process of changing the pickup and pickup-release order in the same step as required (S<b>160</b> to S<b>190</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a figure showing an example of changing the order of picking up and releasing large-sized component Pa, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a table showing a provisionally set initial order of picking up and releasing large-sized component Pa, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is a table showing the order of picking up and releasing after the change in the order. In this process, CPU <b>52</b> determines whether there is a lowered-position held component among the selected components P (S<b>160</b>), and when there is no lowered-position held component, CPU <b>52</b> sets the current component order as same as the order of picking up and releasing in the same step. For example, since the pickup order <b>1</b> to <b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> does not include the lowered-position held component, in this step, the pickup order and the pickup-release order are determined without change (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). On the other hand, when there is a lowered-position held component among the selected components P, the order is changed to an order which makes such a lowered-position held component to be held later with the lowered position, and thereby the pickup order is set (S<b>180</b>). For example, since the pickup order <b>9</b> to <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> includes large-sized component Pa, large-sized component Pa is changed to a later pickup order (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). In mounting head <b>22</b>, only first lifting/lowering position A and second lifting/lowering position B can be lowered to the lowered position, and when large-sized component Pa is picked up prior to other components P, rotary portion <b>42</b> cannot be rotated. Here, since large component Pa is picked up later, it is possible to pick up another component P. When the number of lowered-position held components is smaller than the number of lowered positions, in accordance with the available lowered positions, CPU <b>52</b> may assume an order in which the lowered-position held components are picked up by the lowered positions at the final order position, or assume an order in which the lowered-position held components are picked up at the second from the final order position.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">After S<b>180</b>, CPU <b>52</b> changes to an order in which the lowering-position held component is released earlier and sets the pickup-release order (S<b>190</b>). For example, since the pickup order <b>9</b> to <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> includes large-sized component Pa, the pickup-release order of large-sized component Pa is changed to an earlier order position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). In mounting head <b>22</b>, when pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> is lowered to the lowered position, rotary portion <b>42</b> cannot be rotated. Here, since the lowered-position held component is released earlier, it becomes possible to release another component P. When the number of lowered-position held components held is smaller than the number of lowered positions, CPU <b>52</b>, in accordance with the availabilities, may make a pickup-release order in which the lowered-position held components are released first or make a pickup-release order in which the lowered-position held components are released second from the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After S<b>190</b> or after S<b>170</b>, CPU <b>52</b> determines whether there is a next component P to be picked up (S<b>200</b>), and when there is a next component P to be picked up, that is, when there is a next step, CPU <b>52</b> repeats S<b>110</b> and subsequent processes. On the other hand, when there is no next component P to be picked up in S<b>200</b>, it is assumed that the pickup order and the pickup-release order have been set for all components P, and CPU <b>52</b> determines whether the setting of the pickup and pickup-release orders have been performed a predetermined number of times set beforehand (S<b>210</b>). When the setting of the pickup and pickup-release orders have not reached the predetermined number of times, CPU <b>52</b> changes the setting conditions of the pickup and pickup-release order (S<b>220</b>), and repeats S<b>100</b> and subsequent processes. As a change of the setting condition, for example, CPU <b>52</b> may exchange the placement order of any component P. When S<b>210</b> sets the placement order a predetermined number of times, CPU <b>52</b> selects the shortest one of the set pickup and pickup-release orders (S<b>230</b>), stores the selected pickup and pickup-release orders as mounting-condition information in storage section <b>53</b> (S<b>240</b>), and ends the routine as is. In this manner, mounting-condition information <b>55</b> that causes mounting head <b>22</b> to hold large-sized component Pa together with as many other components P as possible is created. Mounting device <b>11</b> acquires mounting condition information <b>55</b> before executing the mounting process, stores mounting condition information <b>55</b> in storage section <b>32</b> as mounting condition information <b>33</b>, and uses mounting condition information <b>55</b> for the mounting process.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Next, the mounting process executed by mounting device <b>11</b> using the created mounting-condition information will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart showing an example of a mounting process executed by CPU <b>31</b> of mounting device <b>11</b>. This routine is stored in storage section <b>32</b> and executed based on an operator's mounting start input. When this routine is started, CPU <b>31</b> first reads out and acquires mounting-condition information <b>33</b> (S<b>300</b>), and causes board processing section <b>12</b> to perform the conveyance and securing process on board S (S<b>310</b>). Next, CPU <b>31</b> sets component P to be picked up based on the pickup order of mounting-condition information <b>33</b> (S<b>320</b>). Here, it is assumed that CPU <b>31</b> sets one or more components P to be picked up in the same step. Next, CPU <b>31</b> attaches or exchanges pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> as required, and performs a pickup process of component P (S<b>330</b>). At this time, if the lowered-position held component is included in the same step, CPU <b>31</b> picks up the lowered-position held component later. Then, CPU <b>31</b> moves component P so that mounting head <b>22</b> passes over component imaging section <b>16</b> and causes component imaging section <b>16</b> to image held component P (S<b>340</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, by using the captured image, CPU <b>31</b> determines whether there are errors in component P held by mounting head <b>22</b> (S<b>350</b>). Examples of errors in component P include shape abnormalities, a pickup position deviation outside an allowable range, and the like. When there are no errors in held component P, CPU <b>31</b> corrects the pickup position deviation to release component P and position component P on board S (S<b>360</b>). At this time, when the lowered-position held component is included in the same step, CPU <b>31</b> releases the lowered-position held component earlier. On the other hand, when there is an error in held component P in S<b>350</b>, CPU <b>31</b> discards the erroneous component at a predetermined discarding position, corrects the pickup position deviation with respect to the remaining component P and releases component P to place component P on board S (S<b>370</b>). At this time, when the lowered-position held component is included in the same step, CPU <b>31</b> releases the lowered-position held component earlier. CPU <b>31</b> changes the target coordinates of the placement position in mounting-condition information <b>33</b>, and when the lowered-position held component is an erroneous component, CPU <b>31</b> releases the erroneous component at the discarding position earlier, and when the lowered-position held component is not an erroneous component, CPU <b>31</b> releases the erroneous component at the placement position on board S earlier. Subsequently, CPU <b>31</b> sets the discarded component P as a component-to-be-repositioned (S<b>380</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">After S<b>360</b> or after S<b>380</b>, CPU <b>31</b> determines whether the mounting process of the current board has been completed (S<b>390</b>), and if not, executes S<b>320</b> and subsequent processes. That is, CPU <b>31</b> sets component P to be picked up next, exchanges pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> as required, images component P. corrects the deviation, and positions component P on board S. On the other hand, when the mounting process of the current board is completed in S<b>390</b>, CPU <b>31</b> causes board processing section <b>12</b> to discharge board S on which mounting has been completed (S<b>400</b>), and determines whether the mounting jobs of the predetermined mounting-condition information <b>33</b> have been completed (S<b>410</b>). When the mounting jobs of mounting-condition information <b>33</b> are not completed, CPU <b>31</b> executes S<b>310</b> and subsequent processes. When mounting jobs of mounting-condition information <b>33</b> are completed, CPU <b>31</b> determines whether there is a component-to-be-repositioned (S<b>420</b>), and when there is no component-to-be-repositioned, the routine is ended as is.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the other hand, when there is a component-to-be-repositioned in <b>5420</b>, the pickup and pickup-release order setting process is executed for one or more components-to-be-repositioned (S<b>430</b>). This process may be the execution of S<b>100</b> to S<b>190</b> of the mounting-condition setting process routine. That is, CPU <b>31</b> provisionally sets the placement order on the basis of the moving distances of mounting head <b>22</b> and the like, and sets the pickup order and the pickup-release order as they are when there are no lowered-position held components in the same step. On the other hand, when there is a lowered-position held component in the same step, CPU <b>31</b> picks up the lowered-position held component later, and sets the pickup order and the pickup-release order for releasing the lowered-position held component earlier. CPU <b>31</b> then performs the pickup process of the component-to-be-repositioned (S<b>440</b>), corrects the pickup deviation and releases the component-to-be-repositioned to place the component-to-be-repositioned on board S (S<b>450</b>), and ends the routine. In performing the processes of S<b>440</b>, S<b>450</b>, CPU <b>31</b> may perform the processes of the above S<b>340</b>&#x2dc;S<b>380</b>, As described above, mounting device <b>11</b> can hold large-sized member Pa together with general-purpose component P<b>1</b> at the same time and perform the mounting process.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Here, the correspondence between the constituent elements of the present embodiment and the constituent elements of the present disclosure will be specified. Mounting head <b>22</b> of the present embodiment corresponds to the mounting head of the present disclosure, mounting control section <b>30</b> corresponds to the mounting control section, and control device <b>51</b> corresponds to the setting control section. In the present embodiment, an example of the mounting method and the information processing method of the present disclosure is also specified by describing the operations of mounting control section <b>30</b> and control device <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In mounting device <b>11</b> of the present embodiment described above, when the mounting head picks up general-purpose component P<b>1</b> (first component) held by mounting head <b>22</b> at reference height H<b>1</b> and large-sized component Pa (second component) held by mounting head <b>22</b> at lowered position H<b>2</b> lower than reference height H<b>1</b> the second component is picked up later, and when component P is released from mounting head <b>22</b> that has picked up the first component and the second component, the second component is released earlier. In mounting device <b>11</b>, since the second component is held at lowered position H<b>2</b>, it is possible to prevent interference with adjacent pick-up nozzle <b>25</b>, component P picked up by adjacent pick-up nozzle <b>25</b>, or the like. Therefore, for example, the first component and the second component can be held and moved in the same step. Further, picking up the second component first may interfere with picking up the first component, but here, since the second component is picked up after the first component, the first component and the second component can be picked up without interference. Similarly, picking up a nearby first component while second component is held may cause interference with the second component, but here, since the second component is released preferentially, the first component and the second component can be released without interference. As described above, in mounting device <b>11</b>, since the first component and the second component can be picked up, held, and released without interference, the production efficiency can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Mounting head <b>22</b> is a rotary head having a rotary portion <b>42</b> (cylindrical portion) that rotates on an axis, and pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> are attached on the circumference within rotary portion <b>42</b>, and picks up and releases components P while rotating rotary portion <b>42</b>. Mounting control section <b>30</b> does not rotate rotary portion <b>42</b> after the second component is picked up, but rotates rotary portion <b>42</b> after the second component is released. Therefore, in mounting device <b>11</b>, since rotary portion <b>42</b> is not rotated while holding the second component, component P is held more reliably. Further, mounting head <b>22</b> has two or more lowered positions to which pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> is lowered, and mounting control section <b>30</b> causes pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> of the lowered position to pick up the second component at the end of the same step in which mounting head <b>22</b> is caused to pick up multiple components P, and mounting control section <b>30</b> causes pick-up nozzles <b>25</b> at the lowered position to release components earlier starting from the second component held at lowered position H<b>2</b>. In mounting device <b>11</b>, since multiple lowered positions can be effectively utilized, the production efficiency can be further improved. Furthermore, mounting control section <b>30</b> causes pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> at the lower position to pick up the second component, and then causes pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> at the other lower position to pick up the second component when picking up the other second component. In mounting device <b>11</b>, since multiple second components can be picked up, the production efficiency can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, for he component-to-be-repositioned or the like, mounting control section <b>30</b> sets the pickup order in which a second component is picked up by pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> after a first component, and sets the pickup-release order in which a second component is picked by pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> before a first component. In mounting device <b>11</b>, the pickup order and the pickup-release order can be set, for example, even when a change in the mounting order becomes necessary later, the first component and the second component can be mixed and then picked up and released, thereby making it possible to further improve production efficiency. Furthermore, the second component is a large-sized component that interferes with the tip of adjacent pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> and/or a first component held at the tip of adjacent pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> when a second component is picked up by pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> and held at reference height H<b>1</b> In mounting device <b>11</b>, production efficiency can be further improved when a large-sized component is involved.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should be noted that the mounting device and the information processing device of the present disclosure are not limited to the embodiments described above, and may be implemented in various modes as long as they fall within the technical scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, in the embodiment described above, mounting head <b>22</b> has rotary portion <b>42</b>, but is not particularly limited thereto as long as mounting head <b>22</b> holds component P at lowered position H<b>2</b> and need not have rotary portion <b>42</b>. Further, although mounting head <b>22</b> has two lowered positions, the present disclosure is not particularly limited thereto, and mounting head <b>22</b> may have three or more lowered positions or may have only one lowered position. Further, mounting head <b>22</b> has been described as rotating all nozzle holders <b>24</b> at the same time, but the present disclosure is not particularly limited thereto, and nozzle holders <b>24</b> may be configured to rotate individually.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the embodiment described above, mounting device <b>11</b> and management PC <b>50</b> set the pickup order and the pickup-release order, but the present disclosure is not particularly limited thereto, and any one of the devices may set the pickup order and any one of the devices may set the pickup-release order. Also in this mounting system <b>10</b>, it is possible to obtain the same effect as in the above-described embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the embodiment described above, large-sized component Pa is used as the lowered-position held component, but the present disclosure is not particularly limited thereto as long as it is a component that needs to be held at the lowered position. Although general-purpose component P<b>1</b> is the first component, it may be a special component as long as it can be held at reference height H<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the embodiment described above, pick-up nozzle <b>25</b> has been described as a pickup member, but the present disclosure is not particularly limited thereto as long as the pickup member picks up component P, and the pickup member may be, for example, a mechanical chuck that grasps and picks up component P.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the mounting device of the present disclosure, the mounting head is a rotary head having a cylindrical portion that rotates on an axis with the pickup members being attached to the circumference of the cylindrical portion, and is configured to pick up and release components while the cylindrical portion is rotated; and the mounting control section does not rotate the cylindrical portion after picking up the second component but rotates the cylindrical portion after releasing the second component. In this mounting device, since the cylindrical portion is not rotated while holding the second component in the rotary head, the component can be held more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the mounting device of the present disclosure, the mounting head may have two or more lowered positions to which the pickup member is lowered; and the mounting control section causes the pickup member of the lowered position to pick up the second component at the end of the same step in which the mounting head is caused to pick up multiple components, and the mounting control section causes pickup members at the lowered position to release components earlier starting from the second component at the lowered position. Since multiple lowered positions can be effectively utilized with this mounting device, the production efficiency can be further improved. Here, &#x201c;in the same step&#x201d; means, for example, a step in which the mounting head picks up one or more components, and then positions (and discards) the components and move to the next pickup position.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the mounting device of the present disclosure, the mounting head may have two or more lowered positions for lowering the pickup member, and when, after picking up the second component with the pickup member at the lowered position, the mounting control section picks up another second component, the mounting control section may pick up said second component with the pickup member of another lowered position. Since multiple second components can be picked up with this mounting device, the production efficiency can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the mounting device of the present disclosure, the mounting control section may set a pickup order in which the pickup member picks up the second component after the first component, and set a pickup-release order in which the second component is released from the pickup member before the first component. In this mounting device, the pickup order and the pickup-release order can be set, for example, even when a change in the mounting order becomes necessary later, the first component and the second component can be mixed and then picked up and released, thereby making it possible to improve the production efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the mounting device of the present disclosure, the second component may be a large-sized component that interferes with the tip of an adjacent pickup member and/or the first component held by the tip of the adjacent pickup member when picked up by a pickup member and held at a predetermined height. In this mounting device, the production efficiency can be further improved in the case where a large-sized component is involved.</p>
